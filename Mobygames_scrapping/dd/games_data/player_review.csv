Each character the player meets has a rich story, more so enriched by developers who bend over backwards to improve each story.  You can start by rolling your own player character, or play as each of the NPCs, experiencing their story, or as a special character, the dark urge, which adds another storyline to the main story.
The player can carry on through the story with four characters and decide how to handle each encounter through the story.  Each is infected by the Illithid, monsters capable of eating minds and controlling others.  Only, the parasite is not progressing and instead those infected by the parasite become controlled, only not you nor the characters you encounter.  This mystery will be unraveled throughout your journey.
The combat is a pretty good implementation of Dungeons and Dragons 5e, though I'm no expert and there have been complaints about some of the rules.  I found it complex and rich in details, with a lot of choices in how you build your character and create a viable team.  The battles do not hand hold you and you have to take advantage of all the rules in order to survive some of the challenging fights in the game.  The setting itself becomes key to victory, using chandeliers, oil spills, and barrels to damage and frustrate your enemies.
The environments are rich and full of activities and quests to encounter.  It seems as if each corner there is something new to discover, as you explore castles, druid enclaves, the depths of the Underdark, cursed lands, and finally the namesake city Baldur's Gate.  Throughout there are plenty of interesting NPCs to meet and villains to challenges, as the conversations are usually entertaining, humorous, or touching.  The side quests and the characters are the best part of the game.  All are drenched in the world of dungeon's and dragons, as you meet many of the creatures of the world and discover the complex politics of the various races and monsters. The Bad As much as I loved playing the game, I could not give it a five star rating.  There are bugs galore and UI complexities that will drive you crazy.  For instance, in navigating the halls, if one wants to walk through a door, you cannot just click in the middle of the door, as it thinks you want to close the door. You have to turn the camera around and click on the other side of the door.  Want to fire arrows from the top of what looks like an obvious balcony.  Unfortunately, the view is blocked by the railing. 
Overall, there is a lot going right in the game, but modeling such a complex system is bound to have it's issues.  A lot of time it's just trial and error to figure out how things really work in the game.  For instance, the spell confusion should cause enemies to do random activities, but the spell does not work properly so most enemies just continue to attack your party, making it a waste of a spell.
The team at Larian worked really hard to address these issues, but it's just to big and complex a game to get all the issues addressed, so many times you will get frustrated clicking on your characters in a crowd, or directing actions. The Bottom Line The game is an amazing work of fiction merged with gameplay.  All the characters are interesting and the amount of choice in the game that has consequence is beguiling and begs for multiple play throughs.  Well worth a play through, despite the bugs and complexity.",4,,,150689

- Turn-based combat takes way too long compared to BG1/2 RTWP.
- Characters and monsters many actions and move too far per turn.
- It has 4 party members instead of 6 like in BG1/2.
- The UI is very ugly compared to BG1/2.
- The 3D character faces/portraits are very ugly compared to the drawn portraits in BG1/2.
- It includes childish reddit humor like the poop knife.
- It's been in early access for years, but it's still very buggy.
- It's too sexual to the point of being disgusting in my opinion
- The animations are comically bad.
- The PC is not voiced so they just mime in the animated dialogues.
- The companions are extremely unlikeable.
- The environmental graphics tend to be confusing (though not as much as JA3)
- The narrator is a bizarre feature I could go on... The Bottom Line The story of BG ended definitively in BG2 ToB. This is a different game that they cynically put the BG name on. I think that without the name this would be recognized as a bad or mediocre game. Sometimes our memories deceive us, so after finding ""BG3"" so disappointing I went and played BG2 SoA. Yep, it's just as good as I remember it being and much better than ""BG3"".",1,,,150689
https://www.mobygames.com/user/179990/krisko6/,"Link, Find Me!","The Good * The new abilities offer much greater flexibility and depth to traversal, combat, and puzzle solving. Ultrahand lets you get really creative with objects in the world and build almost anything you want. Though largely recycled from its predecessor, the game smartly remixes its old content with new surprises and changes. Dungeons and boss fights are much improved over Breath of the Wild The Sky Islands and the Depths add serious scale and content to the already impressively large world. The Bad * Technical performance issues While overall better, the dungeons may not be enough to satisfy classic Zelda fans. Presentation and visuals still feel too retro at times. Nintendo hasn't quite cracked non-linear storytelling yet. The Bottom Line Few games were as hotly anticipated for 2023 as The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. The seventh 3D game in the iconic series, Tears of the Kingdom is not only the direct sequel to 2017’s Breath of the Wild, it holds the record for the longest development cycle in the entire franchise. It has been over six years since a brand-new Zelda game has been released, without even a handheld entry to tide fans over. You would have to go back to the 1990s to find such a long gap between games, and the length of time between Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom is still longer than that. Still it’s finally here, and though the wait was far longer than anticipated given how much this game recycles from its predecessor, I have to say it was worth it. This is hands-down the best game I’ve played this year, and though the remaining months look to be jam-packed with quality titles, it’s hard to imagine anything else taking the top spot. Tears of the Kingdom opens several years after Breath of the Wild, with Link and Zelda investigating a strange, newly-opened passage underneath the ruins of Hyrule Castle. After coming across a desiccated mummy emanating a red miasma known as “gloom”, Link and Zelda are attacked and get separated, with Zelda falling down into a fissure before disappearing. Link wakes up on a sky island somewhere above Hyrule, his arm replaced by a green cybernetic limb granting him several mysterious new abilities. As a result of the gloom and Link and Zelda’s actions, Hyrule has been altered in numerous ways by the cataclysmic event known as the Upheaval, resulting in numerous changes such as Hyrule Castle getting lifted into the air. Link must track down the whereabouts of the missing Zelda while also finding a way to combat the mysterious ancient evil which has taken over the land. In terms of its story, Tears is generally more exciting that its predecessor, and much more of it happens directly as a result of the player’s actions. Unlike the previous game, it does not simply give away its mysteries from the jump, which is great since it means that basically every character in the game is just as in-the-dark as Link when it comes to wondering what is actually going on. That being said, while the story does have more urgency and more structure, it’s also horribly repetitive, particularly in the cutscenes which culminate the end of every dungeon, which literally offer the exact same exposition dump four times over. The story also utilizes the same structure where you can find various collectibles to trigger flashbacks that can be viewed in any order. All of this means that you’ll probably figure out the various twists way before the game actually intends you to, and while these twists are much more satisfying and unexpected than in the previous game, the story feels like it’s missing some of the depth that Breath of the Wild had. The game also muddies the series timeline even further to the point of irrelevancy, for those who actually care about that. Overall the story is a step forward in some ways, but. I don’t think Nintendo have quite cracked how to tell a wholly satisfying story in a non-linear fashion. That being said, it’s still a delight to catch up to the returning characters from Breath of the Wild and see what they are getting up to in this game. The game really leverages this aspect well, although there were a few characters whom I would have liked to have seen return. Tears of the Kingdom has an extremely similar presentation  to its predecessor, with characters speaking through text boxes along with grunts and sound bites to suggest their voice, with the occasional fully voice-acted cinematic cutscenes to spice things up. To be honest, I was honestly hoping for a bit more voice acting this time around considering that having fully-voiced characters are the standard in AAA games in 2023, but Nintendo have largely stuck to their guns here. What we do get is generally pretty solid for the most part, and there are some truly epic moments during the game’s cinematics. Still, it’s more than a little odd to see a character go from speaking full sentences during one moment then using a dialog box the next, even in the exact same camera shot. Nintendo really needs to ditch the N64-era presentation for future installments, or at the very least keep it consistent. Either give us one or the other, but not both! Tears of the Kingdom is one of the rare direct sequels in the Zelda series, and as a result it uses many of the same fundamentals as its predecessor, right down to having the same map. It’s a rather unusual choice for a sequel, and though this might be a dealbreaker on paper, it’s anything but once you’re actually in the game. The landscape has changed dramatically due to either the Upheaval or the passage of time, and many of the areas you know from Breath of the Wild have been heavily altered. Part of the fun is returning to the places you knew and seeing how they changed, as well as learning about what familiar faces from the first game are getting up to now, now that several years have passed in-universe. Yet there’s so much more to this game than just a remixed map. In terms of its general gameplay, Tears of the Kingdom follows very closely in the footsteps of Breath of the Wild. You’ll still explore the world searching for Shrines, which contain puzzles or challenges to earn points towards upgrading your Hearts of Stamina. You can climb practically any mountainside or surface, which means that if you can see it, you can go to it. You’ll still activate towers to unlock portions of the map, although the way you’ll interact with said towers is much different this time around, since they launch Link up high into the air. Weapon durability has, much to the chagrin of many players, returned. And yes, you’ll still need to search for Koroks to expand your inventory space. This time around, there’s slightly more structure to the proceedings. Breath of the Wild allowed you to pursue Ganon as soon as Link jumped off of the Great Plateau, and while that is certainly possible here, Tears more strongly insists that you complete several objectives first before fighting the final boss. This makes Tears feel a bit more like one of the older Zelda games, though only just a bit, as the progression is still largely open, even if the path to actually completing the game is a bit more hidden from the player this time out. Tears of the Kingdom is the triple-stacked sandwich of open worlds, with not one, but three distinct areas to explore: the Sky Islands, the surface, and the Depths. Each one of these roughly corresponds with a different pillar of gameplay. Together, these three layers complement each other in intriguing ways. The surface focuses mainly on exploration and side quests and is where you will spend the bulk of your time. The landscape now includes proper caves, which contain their own monster types, treasures, and resources to collect, sometimes house Shrines, and can even be used as a shortcut between areas. Admittedly, the game struggles to make each cave feel truly distinct from one another, but generally this is a fantastic addition. In contrast, Sky Islands have a stronger emphasis on puzzle solving. Much of these floating ruins are modular and you’ll start to notice recurring elements such as Zonai relic dispensers and giant stone spheres as you explore them further, but as with the surface, there are certain types of resources and rewards that can only be found in the sky, including treasure maps which can point to the location of various special armor pieces. Most of your time in the air will be spent trying to devise ways to travel between each Sky Island, not too dissimilar to 2011’s Skyward Sword, although you won’t have the luxury of having a Loftwing at your beck and call. Some Sky Islands offer minigame challenges to complete, such as skydiving, which is a lot of fun. I do wish there was a bit more variety in terms of what you can actually find within the Sky Islands, as too many of them are ultimately too similar, but I still found them to be a good addition overall. While you won’t find any Shrines or Koroks in the underworld, the Depths contain the toughest combat encounters, but also the most valuable gear and resources, including more durable weapons, Zonaite for building vehicles and increasing your Zonai battery capacity, and numerous armor pieces inspired by characters from past Zelda games. Going into the Depths is always something of a risk. For starters, the underworld is completely pitch dark until you start placing Brightbloom seeds to light things up. Your primary task is to search for Lightroots, connected to Shrines on the surface, which not only light up the Depths but also reveal parts of the map. The other factor that makes exploring the Depths challenging is that most enemies are afflicted with Gloom, meaning that taking damage from them can actually cause Link to lose hearts which can’t be restored unless you either find a Lightroot, eat certain kinds of food, or return to the surface. The Depths can also sometimes function as a means of travelling back to the surface world to reach otherwise inaccessible areas using Link’s Ascend ability. Some sidequests are designed to take you down into the Depths, and offer very nice rewards for completing them, including an ability that ends up being a huge timesaver. For the most part the Depths are a compelling and at times intensely atmospheric addition to Tears of the Kingdom, although the lack of visual and mechanical variety compared to the surface world or even the Sky Islands can be a bit grating if you stay down there for too long. The other major aspect distinguishing this game from its predecessor are Link’s new core abilities, which completely change how you interact with the world. Gone are the Runes from Breath of the Wild, and this time around there are a host of new powers to play with. The Fuse ability lets you combine weapons, shields, and arrows with nearly any other object in the world: this not only enhances weapons’ durability, it also allows for different effects. Stick a rock onto a stick, and suddenly it’s a hammer, or stick a cart onto a shield and now it’s a skateboard. Discovering the possibilites of this system is a lot of fun, especially when you try out the more “wacky” combinations to see what could happen. This system not only makes collecting resources from fallen enemies much more essential, it also effectively replaces the different arrow types from Breath of the Wild, since resources in your inventory can be used to achieve similar effects, such as sticking a Bomb Flower onto an arrow to create a Bomb Arrow. Most weapons you find will be decayed and relatively weak, though stronger, non-decayed stuff in the Depths exists should you choose to go down there. There’s also Ascend, which lets Link fly up into any ceiling and pop out of the top, which makes vertical traversal so much nicer, and Recall, which allows an object to be sent backwards in time. The real party piece has got to be Ultrahand. At first glance this seems to be a variation of Magnesis from the last game, except now Link is able to pick up pretty much anything that’s not nailed down. However, the real fun comes when you realize that objects can actually be attached together, letting you build so many different things. You’ll start out building bridges and platforms from logs, but eventually you’ll be able to use battery-powered Zonai artifacts to create various types of vehicles, from airplanes and hot air balloons through to cars, trucks, and even mecha and laser cannons. I will say that for as fun as this building system is, it can seem a bit inefficient at times. Most of the time, the simplest vehicles and solutions often work the best, anything that you build is temporary in the world, and when the game expects you to build something, typically most of the pieces will be available in a certain area. Despite this, building Zonai vehicles and other object often provide superior options for mobility and combat in many instances, making it a worthwhile system for imaginative players to take advantage of. The ultrahand system makes attaching pieces together very intuitive, and it works something like Lego. Much like Breath of the Wild, you can expect to see online videos showcasing stuff you didn’t know you could do for years to come. Breath of the Wild’s dungeons were a huge point of contention for many longtime series fans including myself. While a great idea on paper, the Divine Beasts shredded too many conventions when in came to dungeon design. They were far too small and compact, all had the exact same theme, and the boss designs were similar. Tears attempts to fix a couple of those aspects and make some concessions towards fans of the older dungeons. For starters, the visual design of each dungeon is very different, and some of the new concepts are seriously cool, and too good not to spoil. The lead-up to each dungeon is also longer, more elaborate, and substantiative enough that you could technically consider each one a part of the dungeon in its own right. The boss designs feel much more in line with the old-school Zelda games, with each boss being a diverse enemy requiring very specific means to defeat them, and they range from jaw-dropping cinematic spectacles to genuinely challenging, nerve-racking encounters. You’ll even get a map with multiple floors to peruse, much like the older Zelda games. But at the end of the day, these temples ultimately hew very closely to the style of the Divine Beasts. You’ll typically begin in a central area and have to unlock several terminal by solving individual puzzles with the dungeon’s distinct mechanic, here provided by your companions, and each dungeon will take you roughly 20-30 minutes to solve. To their credit, these do a good job of taking advantage of this game’s more open design, but their small size and relative lack of complexity might be something of a bummer for those hoping for the second coming of Ocarina of Time’s Water Temple or the Ancient Cistern. I do believe Tears’ dungeons are generally superior to the Divine Beasts, and can be fun to solve, with the Wind and Lightning dungeons being real standouts in particular. Still, I miss the classic formula, and I would love for the series to find a way to properly bring back the classic-style dungeons in the future, without trying to meet players halfway. The Nintendo Switch was already pretty outdated when it first launched, and six years later, it’s technical power languishes in the face of it’s newer, next-gen competitors. Despite that, Tears of the Kingdom is at times a true technical feat for the tablet console. The fact that you can jump from the sky, to the surface, and all the way down into the depths in one seamless motion without any loading screens at all is seriously impressive from a design standpoint. The draw distance is also much larger than Breath of the Wild’s. The physics engine functions pretty much as you would expect, with surprisingly little of the expected jank that usually comes from incorporating such a complex system in a game. That being said, there are a number of moments when the framerate dips pretty hard, and although some of the more problematic areas are better optimized than in Breath of the Wild, the performance can still be inconsistent where there are too many enemies and physics objects on the screen. It’s hard to argue that Nintendo hasn’t done a lot with their consoles’ meager specs, but I’m not going to lie, Tears of the Kingdom would definitely be an even better game on stronger hardware. I might have come across as a bit more critical than expected given that I love this game, but it’s only because Tears does so many things well that the few things it doesn’t really stand out. Most of the issues from Breath of the Wild have been smoothed over, and its a much larger game to boot. Though it isn’t the perfect fusion of classic and modern Zelda that some perhaps have hoped for, it offers a number of refinements to the new formula and enough changes to the old content to make it worth playing regardless of how one might feel. Ultimately, Tears of the Kingdom made me remember why I remain obsessed with this series.",5,,,203119

The combat system is complex and deep, but can be rewarding for those who enjoy the challenge and the grind for rare gear. The game has a strong focus on lore and storytelling, with memorable characters and a well-crafted world. The Bad Elden Ring is incredibly difficult, with even the simplest encounters proving to be a challenge for many players. This high level of difficulty may be off-putting for those who are not familiar with the genre. The open world is often empty and repetitive, with little to do outside of combat. The lack of content can make the game feel like a chore rather than an enjoyable experience. The story can be convoluted and confusing, making it difficult for me to become invested in the game's narrative. The lack of fast travel options can make traversing the world a tedious and time-consuming experience. The game can be overly reliant on trial-and-error, with little indication or guidance on how to progress or overcome challenges. The game's boss battles can be unfair and imbalanced, with some requiring precise timing and execution that feels more like luck than skill. The Bottom Line Despite its beautiful visuals and impressive combat system, Elden Ring falls short of expectations. Its extreme difficulty and lack of content make it a frustrating experience. The convoluted story also fails to provide a compelling reason to continue playing. Overall, I cannot recommend Elden Ring to anyone but the most dedicated fans of the Soulsborne genre.

While not a major mechanical leap over its predecessor, Ragnarök nevertheless serves as a vital companion piece, picking up right where the 2018 reboot left off, and concluding the series’ Norse era in suitably grand style. If you enjoyed the 2018 reboot, then Ragnarök is appointment gaming. Three years after the events of God of War, and the long winter is coming to an end. Meanwhile, Kratos and a now teenaged Atreus are attempting to keep their heads low to avoid the inevitable coming of Ragnarök. However, Atreus, being the curious boy that he’s always been, has been investigating a means of stopping Ragnarök, which also catches the attention of the god Odin, who warns them not to continue. Not wanting his son to do something reckless, Kratos tags along in the investigation, which leads them to banding forces with the dwarf brothers Brok and Sindri and the newly freed god Tyr to find a way to survive the oncoming apocalypse, and perhaps change their fate. While 2018’s God of War had a relatively straightforward father/son tale, Ragnarök’s story is significantly more complex. There’s a lot more characters to keep track of, and subplots delivered from multiple perspectives that happen in parallel. The main core of the story deals with Kratos and Atreus learning to trust each other: they both have secrets and revelations that they are afraid to let each other know lest it leads to terrible things happening. To be honest, the plot of Ragnarök is far too complicated to easily summarize, and if there’s a complaint, it’s that the story can be a bit too vague and hard-to-follow at times, and in some ways I preferred the more straightforward nature of the previous game. Still, it manages to pull itself together by the end for a satisfying close that’s both rousing and heartbreaking at the same time. One of the reasons why the plot is so much more complex is that you’ll be visiting all nine realms this time around. Places that you didn’t see in the first game such as Vanaheim, Svartalfheim, and Asgard are now open for exploration, although the reality is that some realms got more love than others. There’s about 5 realms which offer the more open level of exploration found in the first game’s hub zone of Midgard, with Musphelheim reserved for trials again, and the rest confined to brief, mission-specific objectives. Even the realms that are revisited from the last game are significantly changed due to the effects of Fimbulwinter: Midgard’s Lake of Nine is now frozen solid, while Alfheim is ravaged by sandstorms. Some of the areas you’ll eventually explore are absurdly dense with side quests and collectables. The combat remains more or less identical to the first, but with a few enhancements on top. You’ll start the game with both the Leviathan Axe and Kratos’ Blades of Chaos, and these can be charged using the Triangle button for additional elemental damage. After using them enough times in battle, individual skills can be upgraded with tokens for additional effects. A shield bash move allows Kratos to deal additional stun damage and knock back enemies, and is required to disrupt particular attacks. This can be used in tandem with the new shield types, which complement different play styles, from defensive blocking, to offensive parrying. There are actually quite a few more new mechanics I could mention, but I won’t delve too deeply into them for spoiler reasons. The previous game was greatly criticized for its lacking enemy variety, however, that is not the case with Ragnarök. While the game does utilize one particular boss fight one too many times, there’s still significantly more enemy types to battle over the journey. Each realm has its own specific enemies that you face, in addition to standard mobs that can be found across the entire game. Bosses are also generally tougher this time around. There’s less emphasis on the “spectacle” fights of the original that eased back on the difficulty in favor of cool factor, though they are still present in a couple of instances. More often than not, you’ll really have to be on top of your game while playing Ragnarök. I’ve heard some talk that this was easier than 2018, but personally speaking I had a much harder time getting through this one. I put the game on Give Me No Mercy mode thinking it wasn’t going to be so difficult after finishing the last game, but boy was I wrong. It is significantly more challenging than the first, although your mileage will vary depending on your skill level and how well you know the combat mechanics. One thing that greatly bugged me about the difficulty was the lack of means to restore Kratos’ health after each encounter. You’ll often have long strings of battles to fight through on a single health bar, and the left over health pickups after every battle are hardly enough to refill Kratos’ health. Sometimes, it was easier to die after a combat encounter I was unprepared for so that I could retry it with a full meter rather than try to tough it out with a sliver of health. I pumped a lot of points into Defense and Vitality, and fully upgraded the new Rage ability to refill Kratos’ health, and yet I was dying more often than I should have. It is possible to interact with the game’s realm travel points to refill Kratos’ health, but the game doesn’t tell you this, and by the time I had found that out I was pretty close to being done with the game. Ragnarök could be more than a bit frustrating at times with its difficulty. The puzzles are fine, but they’re nothing to really write home about. Often, these will come down to just hitting switches with the Leviathan Axe or burning something with the Blades of Chaos. One of the new mechanics you use to solve them was extremely flaky and difficult to consistently work with. Some environments were difficult to read and I would spend a while on a puzzle trying to figure out what exactly the game wanted me to hit despite me knowing I needed to throw or interact with something. Some people on the internet have complained that the game gives you too many hints when solving a puzzle, but if you’re quick enough this is a non-issue at best. Visually, the game is strong. The realms are incredibly varied, motion and facial capture lets each actor’s performance shine through, and it runs at a virtually flawless 60 FPS on PS5. It’s not as much of a graphical leap over its predecessor in the same way that Horizon Forbidden West was over Zero Dawn, and you can perhaps notice a few places where it’s been held back by the PS4’s hardware, but nobody can honestly call this a bad-looking title by any means. Audio is equally solid, with crunchy effects, stellar voice acting performances from all of the cast and a stirring score from Bear McCreary (who also makes a cameo within the game itself). I did run into one bug during my playthrough where a boss fell through the floor as I fought it, but otherwise Ragnarök was a polished and stable experience. While I didn’t quite enjoy my time with Ragnarök as much as with the previous game, thanks to some nagging issues with its difficulty and a more confusing, less involving plot, it’s still among the best games to come out in recent memory. In a year where so many significant titles got delayed, it did a lot to prop up a rather limp holiday release schedule. It’s less of a full-blown sequel and more like the back half of a very, very long game, but when it’s built on top of a strong foundation it’s difficult to complain, especially since it rounds out the current era of the series very well.",4.6,,,195074

https://www.mobygames.com/user/68871/vedder/,Great deck building game,"The Good Great fun, lots of variety. Touch screen controls on Switch work really well. The Bad Some cards are clearly much better than other cards, which isn't necessarily a very bad, but combined with the randomness of what comes available in the shop, this sometimes puts you in a hard spot. Some of the best cards get progressively better over hands played, but if you don't get any of those early on the run will become almost impossible. The Bottom Line Balatro has a lot going for it. If you have some experience with poker it's easy to get into, but it quickly evolves to becomes something else. There's a lot of new content (cards, decks, etc.) to unlock which keep you playing and there's a lot of modifiers which can be added to the game to switch things up and keep things interesting. After playing a couple dozen hands and having won a few rounds I still feel the game has a lot more for me to find out and enjoy. Perhaps it's just me, or I haven't played enough, but a lot of runs appear to devolve into a ""2 pair"" strategy, because that's often the poker hand that's easiest to make. It's a solid strategy, but it does take away some of the variety.

* Great exploration The Bad Completionism impossible without a guide The Bottom Line I wasn't sure I was going to play this. I like MetroidVanias, but having played some really good ones like Hollow Knight and Ori, the chance to disappoint seems quite high... But I guess there was a sale at the right time and I needed something new on my Switch. I wasn't disappointed. I just didn't know I needed this game until I played it! Switching combat for puzzles made the game a lot of fun and feel very unique. The difficulty is pretty spot on. At least for all the puzzles you need to solve to finish the game. Finding the last dozen or so eggs became tedious until resorting to a guide. Not so much because of the difficulty of the puzzles, but the difficulty finding them. Then there's additional layers of puzzles out there which weren't for me, but that's fine. There's a quaint sense of mystery in this game. And the feeling that every room could be hiding something more. And it manages to keep this intrigue all the way through even once you start mastering navigation of its environment, which is really cool. As a puzzle game some of the pitfalls of the Metroidvania genre do become exacerbated. Sometimes it just isn't clear if you have all the tools you need to solve a puzzle. Sporadically this caused me to abandon a puzzle I could've solved, or get confused about a puzzle I couldn't solve yet. I needed some time to get used to the visuals. The protagonist is a bit dull and at the very the start I had some difficulty discerning back from foreground. The lighting effects are pretty cool though. I especially enjoyed tossing firecrackers around to make the world light up. It's great puzzle game. Did it need the additional metroidvania layer? The puzzles are great on their own and I would have enjoyed the game without it, but it was fun to explore the world, which added a whole additional layer of puzzling. So yes it did add a lot!",5,,,223654
https://www.mobygames.com/user/179990/krisko6/,"After 13 years, Half-Life has returned","The Good * Polished gameplay and memorable set pieces Fantastic visuals and sound immerse you in City 17- the best looking VR game so far. Highly detailed physics system Interesting story that dramatically shifts the series' direction The Bad * Combat lacks melee options Paltry weapon selection The Bottom Line It has been 13 years since a Half-Life game has graced our computer screens. That’s long enough for someone in kindergarten to now be in their senior year. Back when social media was an emerging technology rather than the backbone of our cultural consciousness. And years before consumer virtual reality was an available thing. After Half-Life 2: Episode 2’s gut-wrenching cliffhanger ending, Valve had attempted to close out the series with a third Half-Life game, but all of their attempts were in vain. They were waiting for the right time when they could push the limits of technology again, and with the advent of virtual reality, they finally found an avenue to do so. Valve’s first single player game in 9 years, Half-Life Alyx is a midquel taking place 5 years before Gordon Freeman’s arrival in City 17. You play as Alyx Vance, the daughter of former Black Mesa researcher Eli Vance, who has grown up all of her life under the oppressive alien regime, the Combine. After Eli is captured, Alyx teams up with a hacker and inventor named Russell in an attempt to rescue Eli from the Combine. She soon finds herself caught up in a larger task that ultimately involves breaking into the Combine’s Vault, a large floating ship above City 17. Half Life Alyx emphasizes the series’ horror elements much more strongly than in previous games. Compared to the Freeman-led 2D installments, Alyx is a much slower, more methodical affair. Movement speed is slow and platforming is limited to teleportation rather than jump-based movement. Exploration is a much more crucial part of the gameplay as you search in lockers, bins, and trashcans for various pickups along your journey. Your primary means of environmental interaction are the “Russells”, or gravity gloves. These allow you to pick up small items from some distance away. You simply point your hand over the item, grip the trigger, then make a gentle tugging motion to bring the item to your hand so you can catch it. It is incredibly weird at first, but it gradually becomes second-nature as the game goes on. The player can utilize Alyx’s multitool to solve various environmental puzzles. These include manipulating power currents in the walls as well as various simple hacking minigames which take place in 3D space. These grant you access to lockers, doors, and Combine upgrade and power stations. In combat, Alyx can utilize several different types of guns, which are all one-handed so that the player has a free hand to interact with the environment at all times. These include a pistol, a shotgun, and an SMG. Each of these guns can be upgraded at various stations over the course of the game using resin which you can collect through the environments. These upgrades add laser sights, increased ammo count, and alternate fire modes to the weapons. There isn’t enough resin to fully upgrade them all before the game’s end, so you’ll have to be wise in choosing which upgrades you want the most. You have to manually reload each weapon during gameplay, and each one has a different means of reloading. This can be very stressful in the heat of battle. Combat is almost exclusively ranged, so Alyx becomes a game about managing your ammo count closely as you fight enemies. Melee weapons simply don’t exist in the game, and using thrown objects outside of grenades does basically no damage to the enemies. Each chapter introduces new items, weapons, or enemy types so the game never gets too stale throughout its lengthy campaign. There are a few enemy types that are new to this game, including armored headcrabs which can only be shot in a specific place under their belly. One chapter features an encounter with a single enemy hunting the player that is so terrifying it will be difficult to foget anytime soon. That being said, its hard not to feel like Valve could have pushed harder in certain areas. There are only a paltry three weapons to use, plus grenades. Melee is completely absent from the game, meaning that you cannot damage enemies with held or tossed objects. There’s a vaguely shallow feeling in the game’s back half, and while the game delivers lots of fantastic moments, its hard to feel like there could have been just a little bit more to the experience. I’ll admit I experienced some feelings of tedium as I got closer to the game’s end as I had to venture through yet another run-down location digging through every drawer and cabinet for ammo and resin. Half Life: Alyx has been designed with the idea that it will likely be a player’s first VR game in mind. It eases the player very slowly into the game’s mechanics, introducing enemy types and familiarizing players with the tone of the game before cranking things up. Ladders are designed so that simply beginning to climb them will take the player all the way to the top. Entering buildings through windows is done via teleportation. Comfort and playability is a key aspect of designing VR games, and Valve came through with a variety of comfort and locomotion options for the player. These include both teleportation and continuous movement, snap turning, and a crouch button. These options allow the game to be played with virtually any VR setup, including while seated. As the first real single-player game running on Valve’s Source 2 engine, Half-Life Alyx is easily the best-looking and sounding game in VR to date. From the opening view of the City 17 skyline looking directly towards the Citadel, the series has never looked better. The art style is a bit different, more technological and angular, but in some ways it represents a look that Valve had always wanted for City 17 but couldn’t quite have due to the limitations of technology in the 2000’s. But even judged against other VR titles, Alyx is a stunner. Textures and models are highly detailed from all angles, lighting and shadow is effective, and character animations during certain moments are so life-like you can practically feel yourself in the room with them. There are lots of unique models and objects to look at throughout the game and no two areas look the same. There does seem to be some small performance drops during heavy explosions or large daytime environments, but otherwise I can’t fault the visuals on display here. Similarly, the sounds you know and love from previous Half-Life games are present and correct, and have been cleaned up significantly from their 90’s versions. The sound design is highly immersive, especially since the game is more horror-based compared to the previous installments. The voice acting is also strong. I have to give praise especially to Rhys Darby, who absolutely nails his performance as Russell. His dry, sarcastic wit brought a smile to my face every time he chimed in over Alyx’s headset, and he brought a real charm to the game that otherwise wouldn’t be there. Valve has yet another to add to their perfect track record of great companion characters alongside Wheatley, GlaDos, and Alyx herself. While I wouldn’t say that Half Life Alyx is overwhelmingly the best VR game, it is still among the most polished and complete experiences that modern-day VR has to offer. It takes a lot of mechanics seen in other VR games and presents them in a refined package. Make no mistake, this is a landmark title for the medium, but it also shows that there is still plenty of room for it to grow.",4.3,,,143668
https://www.mobygames.com/user/179990/krisko6/,"""It Takes Two to make it out of sight!""","The Good * Highly imaginative, intuitive, and joyous platforming with varied levels and mechanics throughout a lengthy campaign. The game handles genre shifts remarkably well Gorgeous visuals, both artistically and technically A touching love story The Bad * Occasionally cringy dialogue A few unexpected difficulty spikes The Bottom Line It Takes Two is the newest co-operative game from the Swedish developer Hazelight Studios, led by former film director Josef Fares. It Takes Two follows a virtually identical exclusively co-op setup as its predecessor A Way Out, shifting genres from a semi-realistic crime thriller to a cartoonish, lighthearted 3D platformer. As with that game, only one player will need to own It Takes Two, as the other can download a “Friend Pass” to play the game over the internet. The game supports both local couch-co-op or online play between console generations - I played through this on my PS5 while my friend was on his PS4. The storyline of It Takes Two is a truly unusual one to say the least, as it centers around a subject I don’t think any game has ever tackled before: divorce. The title follows May and Cody Goodwin, a married couple living in what appears to be the English countryside who are on the verge of divorce after their relationship has gone sour. Meanwhile, their daughter Rose, who has constructed tiny dolls of her parents made out of wood and clay, retreats to the nearby shed and tries to gather some advice from “The Book of Love”, a tome written by Dr. Hakim who claims to be an expert on repairing relationships. After Rose cries onto the two dolls, the parents suddenly find their souls trapped in the bodies of the dolls on the floor of the shed. With assistance from Dr. Hakim, who appears as a talking Book of Love, the almost-divorcees are forced to work together to reach Rose and undo the curse by conquering a gauntlet of platforming challenges, as they brave the most intense and trippy couples’ therapy session ever devised. It Takes Two places a pretty high emphasis on its story as the players learn how to work together to solve the game’s numerous challenges, even if it can feel at times like a threadbare excuse to link together the game’s wildly varied levels and challenges. The progression of May and Cody’s relationship is handled quite well through the game’s numerous cutscenes as they, and the audience, learn more about each other. Dr. Hakim’s Mexican accent can be laid on a bit too thick at times, and there’s also a surprisingly high amount of distracting profanity in what otherwise appears as a relatively wholesome and cuddly game. I understand that these are adult characters trapped in a childish world of imagination, but it’s hard not to cringe at some lines like Hakim’s “You’re not in a relationship, you’re in a relation-shit!”. The back half of the game’s narrative feels artificially padded and I wish the campaign had found a better way of working those levels into the story instead of the “oops, you’re not quite done yet” approach that the writers take. While the story doesn’t offer any major twists, I personally found the game’s conclusion to be quite touching and satisfying considering all that me and my friend had been through trying to finish this game. But it’s the game’s platforming and wildly inventive level design that’s the real star of the show here. From a journey through a shed filled with living tools, to battling in a war between squirrels and wasps, soaring through space, and exploring the inside of a kaleidoscope and other utterly fantastical places, It Takes Two is relentless in changing up its settings and ideas, always giving new mechanics in each stage to experiment with. Sure, the developers are likely throwing darts at all of the ideas they had, but for the vast majority of the time, they stick thanks to solid, forgiving controls and consistently excellent mechanical design. Each character has a double jump and a dash that can be used for easy in-air maneuverability, and the two easily swing across hooks and grind on rails with a tap of the R1 button. These are the basic fundamentals that are used across the game’s 9 chapters, but It Takes Two offers up so much more. Most stages will equip Cody and May with different abilities and items, which they will need to use in conjunction to overcome the game’s numerous obstacles. These include projectile-based weapons, vehicles, and unique traversal and puzzle-solving abilities, many of which are truly creative and original. It Takes Two may be a puzzlebplatformer at heart, but it’s a true shapeshifter of a game, freely mixing in other genres such as flight, fighting, racing, rhythm, and even action role-playing games. All of these genre shifts were both surprising and competently executed, and both my friend and I found the campaign a consistent delight from start to finish. It Takes Two is for the most part a casual and forgiving game. If one player dies, they can mash the Triangle button to come back to life as long as the other continues to survive. If the other player dies before the first can come back to life, both players get brought back to the previous checkpoint. That being said, the game isn’t afraid to offer the occasional hair-pullingly difficult moment where both players will really have to band together to get past the current obstacle. One boss in particular near the middle of the campaign is one of the most stressful experiences I’ve had playing a game in quite some time, and the sudden and unexpected difficulty spike left my friend and I traumatized for the rest of the campaign. There are other sections that, if you’re not at least competent in video games, can also be a pain to get through. I had considered playing this game with my dad when he comes to visit even though he isn’t too well-versed in modern video games, but after finishing it with my friend I can safely say he wouldn’t have a fun time. In general, I noticed that playing as May demands more difficult platforming on average than Cody, so if you’re playing with a less-skilled gamer you may want to opt to play as her. As with A Way Out, there are numerous competitive minigames featured throughout the campaign that both players can optionally partake in. These “couples’ challenges” can be fun diversions, although some of them feel insubstantial or inconsequential at times. It Take’s Two’s graphics are downright gorgeous, evoking the feeling of playing through a Pixar movie, with an aesthetic reminiscent of Good-Feel’s “crafted-look” platform games like Yoshi’s Crafted World. Animations are expressive, and the lighting, texturing, and use of materials to give everything a handcrafted look is top-notch. While A Way Out was a more subdued game visually thanks to its more realistic tone, It Takes Two has no such constraints, many scenes just explode with colors. As with that game, It Takes Two makes smart use of the split-screen view, resizing or even having one player’s screen completely fill the view to emphasize their actions. Each world is visually stunning and highly detailed apart from maybe the final one, which felt a bit rushed compared to the other sections of the game. Some areas offer detailed settings to explore with different pieces to interact with, while other sections take players on a high-speed rollercoaster ride through dazzling environments.  My only real complaint with the graphics is that the human characters such as Rose can look a bit odd at times, but since most of the game is spent in the crafted world it’s not much of an issue. In terms of technical issues, there were a couple of brief stutters in cutscenes, and a few moments where the sound cut out, these typically happened during saving/loading moments, but otherwise the game is incredibly polished from start to finish. From start to finish, It Takes Two offers some of the most creative and downright fun platforming this side of Nintendo. It’s beautiful, smooth, and consistently inventive with a surprisingly lengthy campaign, and the collaborative aspect really adds a fresh dimension to the genre. There’s a clear tip of the hat to the iconic Japanese game company near the game’s conclusion, which makes it an utter disappointment that the game is currently unavailable on the Nintendo Switch, as any Mario fan with a buddy will easily lap this game up. I’d like to hope that Hazelight and Electronic Arts will one day rectify this, but given their inconsistent support of the hybrid console, that may not happen. Nevertheless, platforming fans who own other consoles or a gaming PC should absolutely take a look at It Takes Two - few games in recent memory have been filled with as many purely magical moments as this one.",4.6,,,161320
https://www.mobygames.com/user/179990/krisko6/,Final Fantasy VII: Reimagined,"The Good * Incredible graphics and cinematic presentation Addictive and dynamic action-combat with turn-based elements Materia system is highly flexible Compelling storyline and characters The Bad * Only a very small portion of the original story Occasional bad textures and pop-in Sidequests are on the basic side The Bottom Line The term “remake” means a lot of different things. For some, it could be a simple as slapping a shiny new coat of paint on an old game, bumping up the textures and resolution and calling it a “remaster”. For others, its a cash grab opportunity to repackage or resell the same game on a new generation of hardware. Sometimes, a game comes along which really blows open the definition of what a remake should be, and Final Fantasy VII Remake is one such game. Despite the title, this is no mere remake, it’s a reimagining. It is effectively a brand new game which utilizes the original’s story beats and characters, but also expands on them and even adds a few new elements of its own, some of which have really divided the Final Fantasy VII fanbase. The decision to split the remake up into multiple installments has infuriated some, and while the story itself is structured as a clear opening act, leaving tons of unresolved characters and plot threads, as a product it offers a full-fledged experience. Final Fantasy VII focused on the story of Cloud Strife, a mercenary who joins up with an eco-terrorist group named AVALANCHE to fight against the Shinra corporation, a company which provides power and security for all but is slowly draining the planet of its most precious resource: mako energy. At first, Cloud is purely working with AVALANCHE solely for the money, but over the course of the game he begins to align with their cause in spite of their sometimes dogged fundamentalism and destructive tendencies, which ruin the lives of those which rely on the Mako power. Soon, however, he discovers there are larger forces at work than Shinra to save or destroy the planet, and a mysterious flower-seller named Aerith Gainsbourgh may be the key to unlocking the deeper conspiracies. Final Fantasy VII Remake largely retells the events of the original leading up to when the player begins to explore the open world map, but it also adds a whole lot of new stuff along the way. Many of the classic characters and scenes are recreated, but some are expanded, such as the ancillary AVALANCHE members like Jesse. Even the infamous cross-dressing scene is included here, an uncomfortably suggestive moment that probably should have landed the game an M rating but somehow didn’t. Fans of the original will be very happy with how Square rebuilt and reimagined many of the original’s famous moments. As someone who had only played a bit of the original game however, the final moments of this game are clearly more coherent to those who are already intimately familiar with the specifics of Final Fantasy VII’s plot. As an almost newcomer of the game, I was more than a little bit lost and confused as to what it all meant, and while some online searches did clear some things up this also spoiled a few plot points from the original game not in the remake that I was not yet familiar with. Many have compared this section to Kingdom Hearts and how vague and nonsensical their stories tend to get, and they’re not wrong. Still, this does leave open some interesting possibilities for the remake series going forward, but how they will address various issues will remain to be seen. I still have a lot of questions, such as which parts of Final Fantasy VII will be represented, and how will character progress transfer over to the subsequent games, if at all? Perhaps the greatest change is in Final Fantasy VII’s combat. Instead of simply re-creating the turn-based combat system of the original, Square have instead chosen to transform it into an action-RPG, while keeping just enough elements of the classic combat intact for long-time fans. The end result is perhaps the best action-based battle system Square Enix has developed, the culmination of everything they have worked towards building over the last decades both with the Kingdom Hearts series as well as the recent Final Fantasy games such as Type-0 and Final Fantasy XV. How it works is relatively straightforward: You’ll attack, dodge, and block just as in an action game, and successful attacks and dodges will fill a character’s ATB meter. When a section of a meter is filled, the player can open a menu while the game slows to a near-pause to use an Ability, Spell, or Item. These must be used at the correct times lest the player gets interrupted by an enemy attack. When your allies’ gauges are filled, you can issue the same commands to them as well. Using the correct attacks and spells on an enemy will build up that enemy’s stagger meter. When this is maxed out, the enemy is stunned for a short while and attacks do much more damage, which can even be increased by certain abilities. Each character plays very differently. Switching between allies will allow you to utilize each character’s special abilities, such as Cloud’s alternate Punisher stance for strong but slow attacks, to Barret’s Overcharge, a devastating shot which can greatly damage enemies. You’ll often be forced to switch, as characters will get stunned or bound by enemies. You can also switch to help a character build up an ATB faster, or switch to a character with more health so that enemies primarily target them instead. By the game’s end, I was constantly switching characters and utilizing nearly all of their abilities to a great extent. While it’s not as relentlessly punishing as the first Kingdom Hearts game, on the Normal difficulty it is by no means a cakewalk like the later Kingdom Hearts games, and the battles will require some strategy and learning to pull off properly, not to mention having the correct Materia equipped. Limit breaks and summons return from the original, and are both highly useful whenever a battle gets too tense. Summons in particular work a bit differently in the remake, as they can only be used during specific fights. You cam bring in one summon for a short amount of time and use the character’s ATB bars to trigger various special attacks for the summon. At the end of the time, they will unleash their ultimate move then vanish from the battlefield. There are a couple of small issues. First the camera can sometimes get a bit finicky especially when dealing with multiple enemies at once. Second, there is no proper jump button, and while aerial attacking isn’t too difficult, it can be a bit inconsistent as to whether or not a character will actually jump up to attack an enemy or not. Finally, some of the spells and status effects are a bit under-utilized compared to some of the others. You’ll make use of the elemental and healing spells constantly, and even the time spells have their use. However, some spells such as Subversion are extremely situational and will only be used in a handful of battles. The main form of character customization is the Materia system, which was also featured in the original game. Essentially, throughout the game you will find or purchase different materia. These can be equipped to add new spells, augment character stats, and add new abilities. There are also special “linking” materia that when used in connected slots along with the right materia, can add various bonus effects. For example, there is a materia which can add an elemental attack to your weapon for some extra damage. These materia will individually level up as you use them, unlocking new spells or increasing their capabilities. This is a great system that provides a lot of flexibility, though in later parts of the game as characters jump in and out of your party in can be a bit tedious to constantly switch your most used materia to a new character . There are several moments of the game where you don’t even play as Cloud, but there’s also some moments near the end where you’ll swap between two parties at once. There is also a second form of customization in the form of the Weapon Upgrade system. As you level up and complete quests, the characters will earn Skill Points, which they can use to upgrade each weapon with new materia slots or stat upgrades. FFVII Remake is mostly structured as a linear, cinematic adventure. You’ll venture through multiple chapters with more or less one straight path and the occasional nook or cranny here and there which usually has items or other goodies stashed away. Some materia can only be acquire by going out of your way to collect them in the game world. However, there are a few chapters where the game eases back on the intensity and opens up for a bit, letting you explore some fairly sizeable hub areas, allowing you to complete various side quests, mini games, and other activities at your leisure. These side quests are pretty basic but they offer some fun character moments and more of that sweet sweet combat. I ended up doing every single one in my playthrough, and I don’t regret doing so. There are a couple of chapters which offer optional arena and VR battles to take part in, and you’re definitely going to want to do these. Some of them will unlock new summons to use while others will grant more powerful limit breaks. In typical Square Enix and Final Fantasy fashion, Final Fantasy VII Remake makes few compromises when it comes to cinematic presentation and graphical fidelity. This game utilizes Unreal Engine 4 to the maximum effect, creating environments and characters which replicate and enhance the classic art design of the original, now in glorious HD and full 3D. Screens which were static in the old game due to PS1 limitations are now more vibrant and alive than ever. During combat, the screen gets so filled with particle effects that it can be hard to make out exactly what is happening at any given time, at least without opening the command menu. There are a couple of places where certain textures are rather substandard, but these are brief moments and don’t ruin the presentation as a while. I also noticed one particular cutscene where Cloud had the wrong sword equipped, this was a result of that particular cutscene being an FMV rather than rendered in-engine, and as soon as it ended Cloud was back with the correct weapon. The PS4 is obviously in its twilight era with the looming launch of the PS5 set for late this year, but Final Fantasy VII Remake is still an impressive showcase of the console’s capabilities, and one of the best-looking games available at the moment. Final Fantasy VII’s soundtrack is widely considered one of the very best soundtracks in video game history, and while I wouldn’t say it is among my favorites, it does capture the Final Fantasy feeling in a way the only the older games could. Many of the songs are catchy and fit the situation well, such as the battle and town themes. The tracks have all been re-recorded for this release and sound better than the synthy bops of the original. There are also a lot of vocal pieces throughout the game, including the end credits song and several others. These really bring the soundtrack to life in a way that the older games were not capable of. The voice acting is very cheesy and anime-style, but I don’t think Final Fantasy fans would really have it any other way. The voices are often heavily exaggerated to the point of parody, but never quite dip over. It may only be a sliver of the original game’s storyline, but nevertheless there is a lot to unpack here. The combat is excellent, the graphics are astonishing, and the world is captivating. I’m very intrigued to see where the story ends up. More importantly, this has me wanting to play the original game so I can see the rest of Final Fantasy VII’s world. It might be set in a horrible dystopian environment, yet ironically its the perfect escape for 50 hours and counting. This is my personal game of 2020 so far.",4.3,,,141485
https://www.mobygames.com/user/179990/krisko6/,Love and hate: two sides of the same coin,"The Good * Incredible technical achievement with stellar graphics, fantastic environments, and superb sound design More open level design offers more options for stealth and traversal Plenty of weapon upgrades and items to craft Solid performances from the cast. The Bad * A ambitiously messy, clumsy storyline Pacing and length issues AI is occasionally dumb Melee dodge feels clunky The Bottom Line With just a few months left to go before the PS5 storms the video game market, Sony is now launching the final exclusive games for the PS4 console. The original The Last of Us launched in 2013 under much the same circumstances, as one of the final exclusive titles for the PS3 console. Honestly, I wasn’t a huge fan of the first. It was one of the first PS3 games I can remember buying. I kept waiting for some sort of transcendent moment to happen during my playthrough but one never did. Many others disagreed, and  The Last of Us is now cited as among the best games of all time. At first I wasn’t planning on playing the sequel. However, after seeing the leaks, the excessive DMCA takedowns, and the controversy surrounding certain plot elements I was starting to get intrigued. Since there are no new movies coming out, The Last of Us Part II is the closest 2020 has to a proper summer blockbuster, so why wouldn’t I want to play the hot new game and give my take on it? The Last of Us Part II opens 5 years after the events of the original game. Joel and Ellie are now living in Jackson, Wyoming, with the world largely unaware of the fact that Ellie is the only known person who holds the secret to curing the plague. After a traumatic and shocking crime occurs in Jackson, Ellie and her new girlfriend, Dina head over to Seattle to seek retribution on an ANTIFA-like militaristic faction, the Washington Liberation Front. While in Seattle, she eventually crosses paths with a dangerous religious cult known as the Seraphites. While the original was a relatively linear plotline, Part II has a considerably more complex narrative structure. On paper, the storyline is brilliant, as it asks us to consider the consequences of violence and the multiple sides to every story. What one person may see as justified is a heinous act in another person’s eyes. It asks us to look beyond mere notions of people being “good” or “evil”. However, the way in which the game goes about exploring this is suspect, to say the least. The story is leaden with so many flashbacks, parallel events, and perspective shifts that the story is at times difficult to follow and the pacing suffers. Since The Last of Us Part II can no longer rely on the shock of a new franchise, this kind of storytelling feels like trying to compensate for having to be a sequel. The only option is to go bigger, louder, messier, gorier, and raunchier, and not every idea is a good one. It’s also a hefty game in terms of its length, clocking in at anywhere from 25-30 hours. It’s by far the longest game Naughty Dog has ever made. In terms of gameplay, Naughty Dog has largely stuck to the stealth/survival horror template of the original The Last of Us. You’ll be traveling through zones filled with human and infected enemies. You can either sneak past them, kill them stealthily, or go in loud and utilize all of your limited weaponry. There will be times when you’re forced to either kill all enemies in order to progress, or run away from them in extended chase sections, so your gameplay will end up being a mix of both tactical styles. Your weaponry consists primarily of guns, melee weapons such as boards and pipes which break after a few uses, and various craft-able items such as silencers and bombs. As you explore each environment, you will pick up various objects that can be used to craft these items, as well as weapon parts to upgrade your guns and pills to upgrade your skills in several trees, all of which are slowly unlocked over the game. There are also various collectibles to find, such as coins and superhero trading cards, which were highly amusing to read about. New to Part II is Ellie’s ability to jump and go prone. The former allows Naughty Dog to create more expansive and vertical environments. The levels often have multiple paths to their endpoint, creating a variety of routes for the player to progress, as well as optional explorable areas. Going prone allows Ellie to hide in grass and crawl under gaps, which makes stealth much easier in certain situations. Part II offers several new types of infected, including some enemies that are heavily armored and aggressive. Human enemies also come in a variety of factions, and some of them now use dogs, which can follow your scent and make hiding that much more difficult when they are around. True to Naughty Dog’s established style, The Last of Us Part II is a highly linear experience. That said, it does flirt with open world gameplay at times, most notably in an early section where you are given free reign to explore a large area of the ruined Seattle. You’re free to visit various points of interest, including a courthouse, several stores, a synagogue, and a bank, in any order that you like, and as you collect items in each location they will be crossed out on the map. It makes for a surprisingly chill experience before the real drama with the human factions begins, even with the occasional infected battle In general, the gameplay is a mostly solid experience. Trying to sneak through a zone and not get caught was tense and sometimes rewarding, while combat against infected was equally fun. I spent my first playthrough on Hard, and it was a fair but not insurmountable challenge. However, I did notice some occasional weird enemy AI issues once or twice such as them somehow not seeing Ellie kill an enemy right where they were looking, which broke immersion a bit. Maybe playing on Survivor I might have seen this less. The game introduces a dodge button for melee, but it still feels a bit clunky to use, since the dodge button is the same as the run button. There are several boss battles which rely solely on this mechanic, but they feel more like quick-time events. I also found the game got kind of tedious towards the end, as it was a very long game with not quite as much variety as it could have had. Graphically, The Last of Us Part II is close to faultless. Never before has a devastated world been rendered with such beauty. The environments are filled with unique, individual details that paint a vivid picture of life before the pandemic hit. There are loads of optional buildings to explore and many of them have their own character. The game does take a fair amount of artistic license with the “real” Seattle, but that’s true of most games set in real-world cities. As a resident of the area, it was fun to see how various buildings were compared to the real ones. True to the real world, Seattle is also an incredibly rainy city, and the floods and storms you’ll frequently witness make for a very dramatic game at times. On the contrast, the game’s violence is ugly and harsh: you’ll frequently see Ellie blow off limbs, slit the throats, and crush the skulls of both infected and human enemies alike. Her brutality it seems, does not discriminate. Indeed, the character animations are mostly fantastic in general, with excellent motion capture and a mostly solid blending system, though I did notice some occasional glitches with the awkward jumping animation. There were a few times where I saw framerate dips, but they happen rarely and don’t impact the experience as a whole. Sound design is also spot on. The soundscape is atmospheric and haunting, from the sound of breaking glass windows to the croaking of clickers, nearly every element is realized effectively. Voice acting is also largely great across the board, and while the script has some issues, the actors deliver very solid performances. The music of the game largely consists of Gustavo Santaolalla’s desolate guitar driven themes, mixed in with a few licensed tunes and some electronic music for the more intense battle sequences. All in all, the game is a technical marvel. The Last of Us Part II does not offer a dramatic departure in gameplay from its predecessor, yet its tone and themes couldn’t be more different. Part II tells one of the medium’s most ambitious stories to date, but boy is it messy. It’s the messy and sprawling nature that makes it a fascinating game, though definitely not a masterpiece like most critics claim. It’s too deliberately imperfect and misshapen for that. It’s the kind of game that for better or worse will have people debating its story decisions for months, if not years to come, and it’s bound to be a cultural lightning rod given the lack of new movies coming this year.",3.7,,,146798
https://www.mobygames.com/user/224832/pag/,The Queen of the Genre Returns,"The Good - ""Item music"". THAT music. Music that is played whenever you gain a new ability item?  It's here. Oh boy. It's stuck in my head. In terms of controls and moves, it's mostly similar to Metroid Fusion on the GBA. The bomb jumping timing feels identical to Super Metroid. Crumbling blocks (pit blocks) behave the same as usual (love them so much). Shinespark controls are mostly similar to Super Metroid as well, but with more moves to be learned and practiced, such as changing the direction in the middle of a shinespark, and morph ball shinespark. The largest arsenal of abilities and items the Metroid series has ever seen. It's like, all of the old abilities will eventually show up here, and quite a few new abilities are put in here too. You are introduced to a new type of obstacle every half hour. And it never gets confusing as to which obstacle is related to which ability. Everytime you gain a new ability, you can explore the entire map all over again to find something new. I also feel that it's the largest 2D Metroid map to date. I would say the map size is twice as big as Super Metroid. The X-Ray scope (called Pulse Radar in this game) is much easier to use now. You can run, morph ball, and space jump around WITH THE X-RAY SCOPE EFFECT turned on, and it shows secret blocks on the entire screen (not just the area you are facing, as was the case in Super Metroid). The biggest problem in Metroid Prime (and all other Metroids for that matter) has been fixed -- it's now much easier to track down missing items. Now, if your item collection rate is at 97% or 98%, and you are wondering where the missing 2% of items are, the game has a hint system for you to find them. It's incredibly useful and fun. After just one month, about 20 sequence breaking techniques have been discovered. There are early bombs, early super missiles, early screw attack, early grapple beam, early gravity suit, underwater jumping without the gravity suit, ... just so many of them, in only one month. The future will be very exciting, with a lot of potential for all kinds of run categories. Some of the techniques are intentional, some not. Sequence breaking is something the Metroid series (in particular, Super Metroid from 1994) started, and the Metroid series is again pioneering this elusive and hardcore type of game design and playstyle. The Metroid series finally has a ""teleport station"" feature -- and they are completely different from the teleport you find in Hollow Knight, Dark Souls, and Castlevania games. The teleport stations come in pairs. You cannot teleport to an arbitrary station like you can in Hollow Knight. Instead, you can only teleport to the other station linked to the current station. This makes routing much more meaningful, as every teleport station will take you to a different destination. Metroidvania games have been adding the teleport feature for years, and we never knew it could be done this way -- and now we know, it feels much superior to the ""teleport anywhere"" system. The queen of the genre returns, to show them how it should be done, the CORRECT way to do a Metroidvania. The Bad - Music is not as memorable as Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion perhaps, but still stronger than Metroid Prime. Roadblocks are created artificially at several points, in order to guide the player to the next item (so they don't wander around without making progress). This feels like hand-holding, and makes sequence breaking harder and puts unnecessary restrictions to runs in general. In particular, the artificial roadblocks would seemingly make the famous ""Reverse Boss Order"" type of runs not possible in this game. People were completing 0% runs only a few days after the game came out. You might wonder what in the world that is. Here's the thing: the item collection rate does not count your ability items. So if you have Super Missiles (ability), Gravity Suit, Screw Attack, and 20 other abilities, it's still possible for you to have an item collection rate of 0%. This feels awkward, and doesn't provide incentive for players to develop Low% strategies (trying to beat the game with as few items as possible). The Bottom Line Metroid fans have been waiting for it, for the last 16 years. For me, it's been 10 years since I played a new 2D metroid, and 7 years since I last played a Metroid game. During that time, we all know what happened: Metroidvania has become a favorite genre among indie game developers and players. Dozens, if not hundreds, of Metroidvania games have been produced. Some went on to be very successful and influential games. But no matter how successful they are, they are not Metroid. They are Super Metroid imitators. Although imitators can do a really good job, it's not the real deal. It doesn't have Samus or the morph ball. It doesn't have the item music. We've all been waiting for the real Queen of the genre to return, to show them what a veteran, full-priced, triple A-quality Metroidvania produced by a big company should look like. A Metroidvania with ITEM MUSIC. We want the real deal, and we got it.",4.9,,,172841

The Bad The discrepancy in difficulty between the boss fights and rest of the gameplay is rather jarring. During exploration and platforming the game doesn't provide much challenge, but during boss fights the game can be hard as nails. I felt the game was a bit too linear. Perhaps there's way to break sequences as is common in these types of games, but there were a bit too many instances of closed doors to guide me some specific path, also at times where I wished to explore.

https://www.mobygames.com/user/179990/krisko6/,"Double the Spider-Man, double the fun!","The Good * Incredible graphics and presentation: a game that makes use of everything the PS5 can do. Greatly improved mechanics in every area, from web-swinging to combat Expertly shifts between the two Spider-Men, with each one having their own abilities, missions, and storylines. New York is bigger and more detailed than the first two games. The Bad * The story, while still enjoyable, is slightly weaker than the first game's Still retains the open-world checklist nature of the original, which some may find repetitive and tedious The Bottom Line Apart from the relase of the PlayStation VR 2 in February, 2023 has been relatively quiet when it comes to major PS5 exclusives, but Sony has finally shaken things up with the release of Spider-Man 2, the highly-anticipated followup to the 2018 original, and PlayStation’s biggest and most important release this year. Sony has promised a shift towards multiplayer and live-service-based titles after this, so this could very well be one of the highest-profile single-player titles for the system for the forseeable future. Nevertheless, I’m pleased to report that Spider-Man 2 delivers everything that is expected of it, and is an experience that showcases the very best of what a AAA video game can do in 2023. Some time after the events of the first game, New York is under the protection of two Spider-Men: the original, Peter Parker and his protegé Miles Morales. Unable to balance his mundane life with his superhero duties, Parker gets fired from his job, but it isn’t long before opportunity comes knocking when his longtime friend Harry Osborn appears at his doorstep, offering him a position at his newly formed research company following extended treatment for a terminal illness which involved the usage of a strange alien organism called a symbiote. Meanwhile, Miles has to spend time preparing for his future, feels that his time as Spider-Man has taken away his life as a student, and is still getting over the death of his father. After New York is threatened by Kraven, a terrorist who hunts supervillians for sport, Miles and Peter are forced to grapple with huge dilemmas in their lives once again: Peter gets infected with the symbiote, which gives him new powers but also alters his personality for the worse, while Miles is confronted with the opportunity to get revenge on Martin Li, the supervillian who killed his father in the first game. While Spider-Man 2 works perfectly well as a standalone story, I would recommend playing the first two games if you haven’t. Not only because they are fantastic games in their own right (especially the first one in particular), but you’ll get a lot more context for everything that happens leading up to this game that just makes evertyhing that much richer. What really makes the game work is in how it balances the typical superhero bombast with intimate moments of mundanity. Insomniac Games understands that the appeal of Spider-Man is in exploring the contrast and relationship between the two sides of its heroes’ lives. There’s a lot of moments in this game where you’re just having an ordinary day like any other, and though these might make for a boring experience on a repeat playthrough, they work wonderfully in the contest of the story, giving emotional weight to the overall experience when the big moments do come. I will say that I’m not completely sure if this story tops the first game’s. There are a few moments which feel out-of-place and either exist for the developers to discuss various causes, or simply kill the momentum, such as the stealth missions where you have to play as the taser-wielding journalist Mary Jane Watson. Nevertheless, the narrative is largely well-written and kept me engaged throughout, mixing aspects that are familiar to fans of either the films or the comics with fresh and unexpected ideas. I think Spider-Man 2, and really this series of games as a whole, represents some of the best superhero content right now in any medium. The main hook of Spider-Man 2 is right there in the name: this time around, you will be controlling both Spider-Men. Main story missions will usually switch between the two heroes at scripted moments, but otherwise you are free to choose which one to control at any time. This system is comparable to Grand Theft Auto V, albeit this time you’re helping the law rather than breaking it. One annoying quirk of this sytem is that the game won’t always tell you if a particular task or mission is locked to the other Spider-Man you aren’t playing as, thankfully switching is instantaneous meaning it’s not as much of an issue as you might think. Each Spider-Man has their own skill tree, suits, and missions to undertake. The game is strictly single-player however, so if you were hoping for a co-op mode where two players can control a single Spider-Man, you’ll have to keep looking. That being said, during random crimes, the other Spider-Man will actually show up to assist, which is an extremely cool touch, although it doen’t happen very often. The traversal of the first game was highly praised in how well it captured both the blistering speed and lithe style of Spider-Man’s web-swinging. The sequel retains all of those mechanics, but also has a new trick up its sleeve in the form of the Web Wings. It’s becoming quite the cliche to just add a glider to every open-world sequel game ever since Breath of the Wild popularized the idea, and though it’s a bit strange for Spider-Man, the Web Wings are a lot of fun to use. You have a lot of control over your glide, but only enough to where you can sense the feeling of being carried along by webs. You will gradually descend and slow down the longer you glide, but finding a vent or a wind tunnel will allow you to glide and ascend much faster. While swinging generally results in faster movement, the Web Wings will give you greater leverage over spaces where there aren’t buildings to swing from. Since the map is much bigger with the Hudson River between its two sides and includes some suburban areas in Queens with low-height houses, gliding is a necessary tool this time around. The stealth system functions largely the same as it did in the first two games: you’ll sneak and web-zip around an environment, creating opportunities to safely knockout enemies by creating distractions with your web shooters. This sytem introduces a new mechanic where you can create web-lines to traverse the environment, which gives you a bit more freedom and flexibility in how you tackle these sections. Eventually, you can unlock an ability to takedown two enemies  while perched from your web-lines, which is great for the last few remaining stealth missions. Miles can also use his camouflage ability to sneak around without being seen, although this ability has been greatly nerfed from his solo game, as the amount of time Miles can remain invisible is much shorter than it was before. Combat has been largely expanded from the first two games. You have all of the same punch, web-shoot, and dodge moves as before, but now each Spider-Man has a loadout of unique abilities they can use on a cooldown timer. These are triggered by hodling down the L1 button and one of the four face buttons. Peter’s abilities are based around the usage of his mechanical Spider-arms and later in the game the symbiote that infects him, while Miles’ are based around the usage of his electric powers. The gadget wheel has been replaced with a similar system for gadget usage. Using these two in concert is the core of the new combat system. For example, you might use a web grabber to put a bunch of baddies in one spot, the follow up with a smashing ability attack for a huge amount of damage. This system makes it extremely easy to work these powerful ailities in with your existing combos, and at higher levels you are nearly unstoppable. That being said, I greatly miss the individual suit powers from the first two games, as they allowed for a greater variety in terms of one’s playstyle, and gave you an incentive to unlock each suit beyond its aesthetics. In lieu of this, we now have the Surge Meter, which when activated greatly increases Peter’s power and gives Miles an ultimate, screen-clearing move, respectively. Overall, however, combat still feels great in this game, with a greater variety of attacks and animations, more responsive controls and less reliance on wave-based encounters, although at times it can be a touch too easy at times even on the hardest difficulty setting available upon launch (there is a harder setting available after you finish the story, but I haven’t tested this). Still, these games are all about the power fantasy, and Spider-Man 2 definitely delivers. Insomniac haven’t compltely broken free of the series’ admittedly dated checkilst design structure when it comes to side missions and activities, but they have alleviated things for a much smoother and more engaging experience overall. While the general quantity of these activites has gone down, the quality of each one is generally higher. For example, Parker and Miles will receive Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man requests through their phones, and each one of these is a completely unique adventure in its own right. Many of these checklist activities offer substantial narrative and gameplay rewards that pay off once you complete them, and they are much faster and more convenient to complete. Spider-Man 2 is one of the PS5’s best looking games, and is among the system’s next-gen showpiece titles. Not only is New York bigger thanks to the new boroughs that have been added, it’s also much more detailed, with unique assets and building textures everywhere you look. The use of ray tracing gives building and puddle reflections an extra sense of realism and color. Animations, particularly during cutscenes, are more lifelike, conveying subtle emotions of each character during conversations and action setpieces. Perhaps the best aspect is in how the game utilizes the SSD of the PS5. This not only allows for nearly instantaneous swapping between the two Spider-Men, it also allows each character to move much faster than before, which makes web swinging and knocking out your remaining map markers that much more fun. This is showcased in an early mission where one Spider-Man is literally thrown halfway across New York in a matter of seconds: I definitely don’t think the PS4 could have done that! All of this runs at an incredibly rock-solid framerate and stability: while I ecnountered a few minor glitches, there wasn’t a single stutter or crash during my entire playthrough. The lack of a true day-night cycle, much like the first game however is a bummer, although I think this has more to do with narrative reasons rather than technical ones. Nevertheless, it would have been nice to have seen a feature like this implemented, especially with the additional power afforded by the PS5. Spider-Man 2 is the most cinematic game to come out in 2023 and is a must-play if you enjoyed the series’ first two outings. It improves on the existing foundation in nearly every way, and while the story perhaps isn’t quite as good as the first, it’s still a wonderful experience all the same. Put simply, it’s a blast.",5,,,210733

- Looks pretty.
- Some welcomed inventory improvements. The Bad What was the point of it?

https://www.mobygames.com/user/1130943/sleepykerr/,Kojimbo has not lost his touch,"The Good Unique game, especially for something of AAA budget and published by Sony. Much of Kojima's trademarks in writing and world-building are present (for better or for worse), perhaps more-so than even in MGS. The joy and engagement of hiking through rough terrain is fully realized here if you allow yourself to be immersed. Picking out paths and balancing only as often as necessary (to avoid slowing down) feels rewarding and engaging. This game is CHILL as hell. It also gets spooky at times with BT encounters. I remember my first exposure to BTs felt oppressively tense and it was not something I have felt from a game in a while. The sound design was also a highlight for me. Many of the computer-y sounds reminded me of some of my favorite sounds from The Division, and the general soundscape feels really well made. The cutscenes are all live rendered, which does a huge favor for both visual presentation and gameplay-cutscene consistency. The cutscenes are beautiful in an oftentimes understated and nuanced way. Kojima's love for cinema really is obvious here. Almost all of the characters are memorable, unique, and seem to serve a narrative purpose. One of my favorite characters has some cutscenes where he makes the main character (and by extension, the player) feel uncomfortable in a way I have never seen intentionally done in a game before, which I found really neat, especially considering the somewhat anti-social context of this character's past. The Bad Has issues with time wasting in UI and interaction and still feels slightly limited in scope/intricacy compared to something more unapolegetically sim. The vehicle handling makes me especially sad, and I am begging for good vehicle physics in the upcoming second game. The boss fights are mechanically mediocre, and the atmosphere of BT encounters will wear off after they become trivialized by your knowledge of their gameplay functionality. Kojima has always seemed to struggle with writing women consistently, and often falls into writing characters in a manner that is perverted, utilitarian, or otherwise disrespectful in some way, and this game has a few of these moments, though I wouldn't consider them too egregious. The Bottom Line Really cool game. Subverts (to a large extent at least) the industry standard unremarkability that is characteristic of other high budget AAA games. Slightly more depth and scope to some mechanics such as vehicles and combat would have been really nice.",4,,,172725

https://www.mobygames.com/user/68871/vedder/,Worthy sequel,"The Good Many of the environments are quite stunning. The game has a large selection of excellent puzzles. Some can be quite challenging, but I only had to resort to outside help once. The different ""humans"" providing different philosophical insights worked well and perhaps better than the failed predecessors of the previous game, as they felt more alive. The Bad Bigger isn't always better. The world in The Talos Principle 2 is vast, but often the size is just becomes annoying to traverse, or the repeat of megascan assets just becomes apparent. Some of the puzzle concepts introduced later in the game just don't work as neatly as the earlier concepts or those from the previous game. I didn't necessarily want more tetromino puzzles. The Bottom Line The Talos Principle was a surprise favourite for me. So its sequel had a lot to live up to. On the puzzle front the game definitely delivers. I had a lot of fun solving all the puzzles the game had to offer. There are quite a lot of new mechanics introduced throughout the game which ramp up the variety. There's also a lot more of them I think. The additional challenges each ""world"" contained were of a more mixed quality and generally just involved a lot of walking around. And not always very purposefully. Where the first game explores what it is to be human, part 2 focuses on a new philosophical question: what the meaning of life is. The other ""humans"" give a more lively conversation which is nice, but I must admit this second offering doesn't feel as profound as the first. It's still great, but the novelty has perhaps worn of a bit. Still the game comes highly recommended if you like either a good puzzle game or a philosophical debate, but mostly if you like both.",4,,,211252

* Super smooth gameplay
* Healthy mix of combat and puzzle-platforming The Bad Can get rather frustrating, but luckily mostly in the optional content.
* Switch couldn't keep a stable framerate in all areas. The Bottom Line The game starts a bit more story heavy and linear before it manages to open up and shine. Once it does it becomes a fantastic, but mostly by-the-book MetroidVania game. The world is quite big and looks great. You unlock mostly typical powers like a hook-shot, double jump, something to by-pass a door etc. But for a bunch of the powers there are additional ways to use them both in combat and puzzle areas which adds another level of depth. A bunch of bosses need to be fought to show you got your unlocked powers under control. The game adds some character customization. The charms seem interesting at first, but most just aren't that interesting except in very specific situations. Some add cool abilities, but in the end I just ended up picking those that flat out make me more powerful in combat. Athra Surges all seemed quite similar and more often activated by accident than intentionally. So in the end the customization wasn't all that rewarding for me. Controls are super smooth as you'd expect/hope from a MetroidVania and it's cool to explore all the locations, which all have their own twist. The game has some cool throwbacks to older games in the series. But at other times I felt like I ended up in a Rayman level instead. Where the game tries to establish a believable gameworld at the start, mid-game it lets go of all pretense and focuses fully on the gameplay with very silly premises. Luckily I love Rayman. The silliness also extends to the story which tries to be serious at the start, but at some points revolves around murdering the entire cast to convince them you are being framed. And each of them realizes you must have been right since you could defeat them in their dying breath? What? That brings us to the platforming. There's quite a lot of intense platforming sections. If you keep on the main path they become quite tough, but remain fair. For some of the optional treasures and a specific challenge section the fairness is debatable. In any case I didn't find enjoyment in learning movement patterns lasting several minutes and gave up on some of them. For the challenge rooms especially they also dictate which powers you can or cannot use, so you can't even come back later when you are more powerful, which is kind of one of the great things about MetroidVanias... Guess I won't get this to 100% completion. Some frustrations aside, in the end I'd rank this right beside my favourite MetroidVanias Ori and Hollow Knight. What it lacks in coherent world building it makes up with super smooth gameplay.",5,,,216014
https://www.mobygames.com/user/68871/vedder/,Adrenalin pumping action,"The Good Doom Eternal is a very visceral experience, and it does this really well. The Bad After the first or so mission the game becomes utterly overwhelming with dozens of resources, weapons, mechanics, upgrade paths, etc. it all wishes to explain at the same time. While they add depth to the game they offer so at the wrong time. The monkey bars feel like a prototype at best, with no animations to support them. And even if they did, they feel completely out of place in the game. The Bottom Line I'm not a huge fan of Doom. I do have fond nostalgic memories of the original, but didn't think Doom II was as anywhere near as good. Doom 3 was alright as some kind of action horror game. I never really played Doom 2016. Playing this in a time where I don't really care about shooters anymore, I can see the appeal it would've had for a younger me. I did enjoy the couple levels I played. And I might play more if I feel the need for some mindless action. It's full of secrets to find, and a younger me might've gone and collected them all. But for now the lack of emotional connection to the game kind of hampers the drive to continue. The story is completely out there and unintelligible with a new character being introduced every level. I'm not even sure why it's there to be honest. The story beats perhaps serve just as a cooldown, much like the platforming segments. That said it's probably the best Doom I've played since the original, but it mostly made me realize my taste in game has moved to other pastures since my teens. I'd much rather play a shooter with a bit more story like Half-Life, but this is still muuuch more enjoyable than the next Call of Duty or Battlefield single player campaign.",3,,,143581
https://www.mobygames.com/user/48599/the-fabulous-king/,One of the most artistically ambitious games ever made,"The Good I've played most of Obsidian's games, and now that I think about it, religion has always been present in Obsidian's writing. Remember Joshua Graham from Honest Hearts? A man burning with the fires of shame, guilt and the drive to make it up to his Creator that has given him another chance? A man casually dropping Bible quotes, because these are a sweet nectar to him? Or Pillars of Eternity, which managed to portray personal faith of it's characters in a manner that was very true and human. Even if they believed in fictional gods, the way they believed was very much like how real people believe. There was someone working in Obsidian who understood religion and especially what that reveals about human condition. Now don't start thinking that this game - Pentiment - is going to be a Jesus propaganda. No, far from it. But if you want to capture something true about human condition, you will eventually have to deal with religion and philosophy. Turns out that Joshua Sawyer had wanted to make something truly artistic for a long time. Just waiting for the right chance. He's been making RPG's his entire life. And when he finally switches genres, he creates his magnum opus. Pentiment is an adventure game. It belongs to the same genre as Monkey Island and Gabriel Knight. Now, if you are going to be very mean, you can say that it's just an interactive book, because you'll be reading so much text. Fine... For it is indeed designed as a book. It purposefully evokes medieval manuscripts in it's art and even script appearance. Sometimes, like with a medieval script, a word will be written wrongly, then erased and rewritten correctly. Pentiment, the title of the game itself, means writing or painting over something. Everything in this game is because of a focused artistic vision. It's all about this central theme. Medieval Bavaria, during the time of early Reformation and Peasant War. The character you play believes in God and Devil, Heaven and Hell, Curse and Blessing. Everyone in this world takes these things for granted and it's in this framework that they will wrestle with the difficult questions about human misery. The events of this game can be quite sad and tragic. And you are never given the certainty that you have made the right choices. There is something very raw and shocking to see the person you accused, executed brutally in front of your eyes, pleading for his life. But it's not just misery you will experience. It's also the small joys, the tiny moments of happiness that give us hope. It's telling that the designers of this game worked so hard to portray medieval eating as accurately as possible. You'll be making choices with whom you will eat together, with whom you will have relationship with. It was important for Josh Sawyer for the player to experience human condition like this. Sharing bread has always been one of the most fundamental ways people relate to each other. It's a very rich game, in it's visual design, it's writing (the conversations you will have about medieval theology), the situations it puts you in, the historical background of these events... It captures something very true about the human condition and will give you deeper insights every time you play it. Like a true work of art. The Bad A complaint is made that this game gives you illusory choices. Now if I said it's part of the point, would it satisfy you? But Pentiment is an existentialist work. In games that give you power fantasy, you can make all the right choices and save everyone. But Pentiment is not about this power fantasy. In the eyes of the Eternal Judge... or the Great Nothingness, if you prefer that there is nothing but the meaning we make ourselves - you can only represent yourself (the main character of this game, as he stands under the eyes of the God he believes in). You cannot make choices for other people. Just because you played it right, you cannot avert an historical tragedy (The Peasant War) that happens anyway, no matter what choices you made. People can be driven to do horrible things. And sometimes it was they themselves that drove them to do horrible things. Still, as a game made by designers that have always prided themselves in giving player choices, this game does purposefully err against standard player experience conventions, which can be off-putting to people. You cannot even save your game. And you probably did made a mistake, and the consequences were not to your liking. There is no reload button in life. So why would there be in a game that tries to say something about what it is to live? We all have to live with our mistakes, including your character in this game. This game will not make you feel good. But it will evoke in you what it is to be human. The Bottom Line There is nothing else like it. This game was purposefully designed to be art. And it's one the greatest games ever made.",5,,,194426
https://www.mobygames.com/user/68871/vedder/,Medieval whodunit,"The Good Reading about the game beforehand I wasn't sure whether I'd love it or hate it. It has its quirks, but in the end I really liked it a lot. The story is really well told, and proves a great whodunit. Especially the first part of the game really shines in this regard, as you really want to find the perpetrator. The realistic historic setting were a great change of pace compared to the abundance of generic fantasy and sci-fi settings we see in games. It showed a great attention to detail, and the glossary allowed for some brief background information on all the things medieval and Roman you might not be familiar with. I liked the mechanic where I really had to choose where to invest my time. It clearly had a big influence on my further actions in the world. I feel a bit ambivalent about the game's visual quality, but I like how they tried to keep it in a medieval style. It's surely unique and that's appreciated. The Bad The game doesn't start very strong until the first major event there isn't much of a hook, but once you start being the detective it becomes great. The game has three major parts, and the last of those didn't feel as nice as the previous two. The change of character felt a bit weird, your actions feel less consequential, and at this point I had pretty much solved the whodunit, but the game wouldn't let me solve it, because it had other plans. The Bottom Line For the most part of the game it feels like you are the one in control of the plot and that's the parts where Pentiment shines most brightly. It suffers a bit at the very start and during a dragging end, but that certainly won't spoil the overall fun of this game. Considering its setting and visuals it won't be for everyone, but I certainly loved it.",4,,,194426
,"Well-rounded, pleasant and intriguing experience.","The Good An adventure of the 20s, in that it is more of a visual novel without the manga graphics (but then, even Japanese visual novels are forgoing manga graphics in favor of other styles that better raise revenues). You mostly explore (some things optionally, some other necessarily), choice between dialogue options that affect  extensively and meaningfully dialogues to come and whole plot. While exploring locales and dialogue options and plot branches, you enjoy the aural pleasantry and graphical richness of the game — the latter whereof calls for being remarked on. Play choices will shape your character, and its reputation, in one of a rather wide gamut of fashions. Narrative paths will vary accordingly, leading the plot to one of several finals, as different from one another as to be able to be seen as diverse endings, and merit, if you  have gotten fond of the game, one or two replays. The game is rather deep in its narration, rich in the variety of its cast of types, courageous in what subjects it selected to tackle.  As a Western-style visual novel, it leaves very few to no boxes unchecked. The Bad If you hunger for adventures that aren't visual novels presented in a way formally enabling them to get the ""adventure label"", if you want to face problem solving challenges of any kind that goes beyond choosing if you prefer advancing dialogues and moving your playing character with the keyboard or mouse, this game isn't mean to offer any. The Bottom Line A valuable, in spots and at times much so, visual novel in the Western fashion, as such presented and marketed as an adventure game. Warmly recommended, if you are looking for one.
But: wouldn't it be fairer to market and sell these games for what they are, rather than as ""adventure""?",4,,,194426
https://www.mobygames.com/user/1152593/dafygaminghub/,Cyberpunk 2077 Review: Flawed Redemption,"The Good Night City is an absolute visual and atmospheric triumph, with unparalleled art and sound design that perfectly capture the cyberpunk aesthetic. This immersive backdrop is home to revamped combat and deep character progression that are genuinely thrilling, allowing for incredibly fun and diverse playstyles. At its core, the main story delivers a compelling, noir-inspired narrative, driven by the fantastic and memorable dynamic with Johnny Silverhand. This level of quality culminates in the Phantom Liberty expansion, a focused, high-stakes experience that represents the game at its absolute best. The Bad However, beneath its stunning visuals, the world is a ""beautiful but hollow corpse,"" with lifeless NPCs and a near-nonexistent simulation that shatters immersion. This lack of depth extends to core systems like stealth, which remain disappointingly simplistic. The game’s quality is wildly inconsistent, with brilliant, memorable side quests existing right alongside forgettable and repetitive filler content. Ultimately, a heavy reliance on the PC modding community to fix fundamental issues means that console players are left with an inherently inferior experience. The Bottom Line Cyberpunk 2077 is now a compelling, deeply flawed RPG that I can finally recommend. If you value a spectacular world, fun combat, and a great story, and you're willing to overlook the shallow simulation under the surface, you'll find a brilliant redemption story. It’s not the genre-defining masterpiece we were promised, but it's a hell of a ride.",4,,,209361
https://www.mobygames.com/user/179990/krisko6/,"Go West, Young Huntress","The Good * A massive, hefty game with a lot to see and do - much of it of high quality Graphically impressive and artistically diverse world Combat is as fun as ever, now with plenty of new toys and enhancements to melee mechanics Side characters are wonderfully fleshed-out The Bad * Overall story isn't as compelling or believable as Zero Dawn. Main missions take way too long to complete on average. Locking exploration and side content behind key items is unnecessary and poorly signposted Weapon/Outfit upgrade mechanics are unnecessarily tedious Some minor graphical glitches/crashes The Bottom Line 5 years have passed since Guerrilla Games introduced one of gaming’s best new IPs with Horizon Zero Dawn, a rookie entry into the open world action/RPG genre that stood toe-to-toe with and in some cases surpassed some of the genre’s biggest and longest-standing names. Now, after several pandemic-induced delays, the series makes its next-gen debut with the sequel Horizon Forbidden West, which not only continues Aloy’s story from where the first left off, but also overhauls and expands the gameplay systems of the first. The end result is an impressively fleshed-out and exhaustively indulgent sequel that should please most fans of the first game, although there are a few aspects which might leave some scratching their head. Taking place six months after Zero Dawn’s ending, the new title sees Aloy, now having accepted her responsibility and lineage as Earth’s protector, on the hunt for a way to stop a deadly red blight from consuming the Earth. Her search eventually takes her beyond the Carja Sundom into the Forbidden West, where she gets caught up in a civil war between the Tenakth clans instigated primarily by Regalla, all the while investigating a mysterious technologically advanced group of new arrivals who wish to take control of the planet’s terraforming systems for themselves. Part of the fun is seeing Aloy rediscover and meet up with characters from Zero Dawn. Though there is a recap of the first game’s basic plot points presented for newcomers once you boot up the game for the first time, you’ll appreciate this game a whole lot more if you have played Zero Dawn. I had just finished a replay of the first game the night before this released, and having everything about it fresh in my mind, I appreciated the numerous callbacks and character moments presented in Forbidden West so much more. While Zero Dawn’s story followed two main threads, one in the present and one in the past, Forbidden West’s focus lies mostly on the here and now. You’ll still do plenty of delving into the ruins of “The Metal World”, but the strong mystery element that made the first game’s story work so well has been somewhat downplayed here. There’s certainly a lot of past lore to uncover, but the emphasis is less on Aloy’s journey of self-discovery and more about renewing and healing the post-apocalyptic world. It’s certainly not bad, but it simply isn’t quite as compelling as what came before. Some may also feel that certain plot aspects drift too far into the realm of science-fantasy, compared to the relatively grounded feel of Zero Dawn. There are also some pacing issues: most main missions can take up to an hour or more to complete, so be ready for a long, long sit if you plan on advancing the story, especially if you plan on talking to every character and asking every question (and believe me, if you’re a fan like I am, you’ll want to). That being said, while the main plot may be a bit slack, the side characters really shine in this installment. Each of your companions is far more fleshed out, with top quality voice acting for nearly all of them (minus one later character) and all of them represent different factions within the game’s world. At some point during the game, you’ll establish a base where you can carry out optional conversations with each of your companions, which turns out to be a nice Mass Effect-influenced touch, since there’s so much dialogue to go through and you can really get a sense of what each one represents. I’ve always maintained that Horizon was meant to be Sony’s answer to the Legend of Zelda, and Forbidden West doubles down on that comparison even more than the first game, although in ways that might be a bit to its detriment. Key items and gadgets for traversal and progression play a much bigger part in this game than they did in the first. I’m sure you’ve seen the glider that Aloy uses in this game (I wonder where Guerrilla got that idea from), but that’s just one of several new tools you get over the course of the journey, including the pullcaster, which is essentially the Hookshot, and a device which allows Aloy to breathe indefinitely underwater. On the one hand, this results in a bit of a different feeling for exploration compared to the first game, especially early on. It brings back the thrill of the pre- Breath of the Wild Zelda games, giving you an incentive to return to places you thought you had thoroughly explored. On the other hand, the number of times I ran across a ruin or a cave I could not explore due to not having the correct equipment was more excessive than I would have liked. Not only is this approach fundamentally different from the first game’s, which hardly ever locked off anything until you had completed certain main missions, it also compromises the sense of freedom and exploration that the first game did so well, and I’m not completely sure why this change was made. The worst moment was when I started a side mission which was impossible to complete because I did not have the underwater breathing upgrade - I’ve never had to just up and walk away from a Horizon mission while I’m in the middle of it until now. I wish the game had done a better job at actually signposting, or at least blocking these areas off before you decide to investigate them, as the number of times the game says “no” is way more than it should be. Still, given how large and expansive the world is, and how much there is to see and do, it’s a minor gripe in the grand scheme of things. Combat is similar to the first game at first glance, but there have been a lot of changes under the hood. Your weapon wheel now allows you to store up to six different weapons in your loadout, and considering the exponential amount of new ammo types, you’re going to want to make full use of those slots. New combat mechanics include Weapon Techniques, which are special attacks you can use with each weapon type, and Valor Surges, which are unlocked on each skill tree and can be used once your Valor Gauge builds up. These can really turn the tide of combat when they’re used correctly, especially when used at max level. The game introduces many new and returning machine types from the first. Human combat has also been beefed up considerably: where in the first game most human enemies were paper bags that would go down in a couple of hits, here they’re bulked out in armor, use shields and heavy weapons, and won’t just flinch from a headshot with a basic bow. Some of them also ride on machines, which means you’ll often need to deal with the machine as well when fighting them. Melee has also been hugely overhauled from the first game, with more emphasis placed on using specific combos to gain the upper hand. Spear attacks are generally weaker than those in the first game, so you’ll really need to pump points into the warrior tree and associated outfits and keep the combos in mind to make yourself an effective melee fighter, even as the emphasis largely remains on ranged combat. As an example, one special move Aloy can do is a Resonance Blast - by hitting enemies with melee attacks, her spear can build up energy, which you can place on an enemy and hit with a projectile to score massive damage. It all comes back to your aiming skills. That being said, the absence of any sort of block feature is puzzling: melee combat is meant to be more of a complement rather than the main approach, but the inclusion of several difficult melee only activities means your only defense is dodging constantly without so much as a block or parry function. Another major change comes in the game’s RPG mechanics and skill systems. In an attempt to encourage build diversity, there are now six skill trees to choose from, and you can choose from a mix of passive bonuses, active skills, Weapon Techniques, and Valor Surges, which are unique to each tree. Outfits not only provide various types of defense, but also enhance the attributes of these individual trees. To be honest, this is a double-edged sword: I loved that the game presented me with more choices, and having Weapon Techniques and Valor Surges unique to each tree means that no two players are going to have the exact same loadout. On the other hand, the skill upgrades from the first game felt much more meaningful: the majority of upgrades here are passive bonuses or situational skills that you’ll hardly notice while playing, and some trees are just objectively better than others. Thankfully, most of the skills which were previously locked behind upgrades in the first are now given to Aloy by default in this game, though for some reason it’s never explained why she chose to drop most of her old equipment. Weapons also require considerable amounts of resources to upgrade to maximum strength and utilize all of their mod slots, which means you’ll really need to be sure you want to invest more in a weapon before upgrading it, a hard decision to make when the game is often showering you with new weapons after completing quests. This game wants you to exercise restraint in killing machines: tearing off certain parts before they are killed, and making sure you don’t destroy containers for easy explosions, although this can be adjusted in the difficulty settings if you so desire. You can create jobs to keep track of the upgrades that you want as well as possible locations to collect the materials that you need, although there is no way to quickly view these once you’re out in the wild, which feels like a quality of life oversight. The slow upgrade process for weapons meant that I always felt like I was somewhat behind the curve, especially the further I got into the game, when several missions grant new armor and weapon types. There’s isn’t much incentive to actually browse the shops, as completing quests usually gives weapon and gear types that are just as functional. All of these changes combined make for a much more difficult game than its predecessor. Zero Dawn was not a cakewalk, but it was much more manageable once you got to grips with its mechanics. Not only does Forbidden West completely overhaul those mechanics, forcing you to learn the game all over again, it’s also just a more difficult experience in general. Some of the new machines are downright terrifying to face, especially without a companion in tow, and making full use of Weapon Techniques and Valor Surges is essential for survival. I think I spent over an hour on one particular fight. It wasn’t until very late in the game, that having built up my arsenal and unlocked Weapon Techniques for each of my weapons did I truly begin to feel comfortable with consistently taking on the biggest machines. The game’s climbing system has also been overhauled, although this can prove to be a bit finicky to use at times. In the first game, Aloy could only climb along preset paths which either consisted of yellow climbable objects and white ledges. Despite early trailers indicating the game seemingly adopting Breath of the Wild’s climb-anywhere mechanics, it’s ultimately a slight variation of the first game’s system, and not always for the better. When climbing, you’ll often have more directions which you can move in, but you’re still only able to climb specific walls and cliffs, meaning it’s effectively the same. The yellow lines used to highlight climbable areas can sometimes be difficult to read, and there were several moments where it seemed like Aloy should be close enough to grab something or climb up a ledge, yet she won’t. Or, she will hang off certain ledges at funky angles. It just isn’t as refined as it should be, especially when you compare it to the competition. At least there’s an attempt to introduce some new platforming mechanics, including wall jumps and backwards leaps, although with the exception of using the pullcaster you’re rarely required to actually use these during traversal. Zero Dawn had no shortage of optional side content for the player to engage with, and Forbidden West easily goes a step or two beyond what that first title offered. This is a HUGE game with so much to do, and almost all of it at a consistently high level of quality. Most of the classic activities return, including Cauldrons, Hunting Grounds, Vantage Points, and Bandit Camps (here called Rebel Camps and Rebel Outposts). But there’s so much more beyond those. The new offerings include Melee Pits, where you can practice and battle against various opponents using the melee combat techniques, eventually working your way up to battling “the Enduring”; Relic Ruins, puzzle areas which are essentially this game’s take on Breath of the Wild’s Shrines; and Machine Strike, a chess-like board game where players collect and battle machine pieces on various boards, utilizing the terrain and skill types to claim victory. Perhaps the most challenging activity is the Arena, which is found in roughly the middle of the game and allows you to go up against the game’s toughest machines in timed combat trials. All that on top of numerous side quests and errands, of course, many of which offer either interesting bits of lore or great rewards, including new and unique weapon types. Once you get into the swing of things, it’s hard to stop. Though it’s now a five-year old game, Zero Dawn is still up there with the best looking titles, so it’s no surprise that the sequel is even better. Some might be bummed that Forbidden West is a cross-gen game rather than the full next-gen sequel that was anticipated, but honestly, Forbidden West looks better than most games coming out today even on the PS4. The main upgrades for the PS5 version are resolution and framerate. You can either choose to run the game at full 4K or at a lower resolution with a mostly-fluid 60 fps framerate. Either way, the game is stunning. It’s not just in the technical aspects, the art and design of the game is incredibly eye-catching throughout. Some of the settlements have incredibly unique and dense designs that I’ve never seen in a video game before, and they’re usually populated with more NPCs compared to the first game. Cutscenes are more dynamic than the original, allowing characters to move around and really express their emotions in ways the more limiting Zero Dawn could not. The PS5 version also takes advantage of the controller’s haptics and adaptive triggers to give extra oomph to sensations. You’ll feel the tightness of a bowstring as a weapon gets overdrawn, and the bulkiness of aiming a heavy weapon. There are also several major Uncharted-style action setpieces sprinkled throughout, which gives the game a greater sense of scale and spectacle than its predecessor. And, yes, the water is much, much better looking here than it was in the first game - deep, blue, and reflective. I have noticed a few visual bugs such as pop-in, sudden black screens, and shimmering textures from time to time, but generally speaking the game is more often than not a polished experience. I would have loved to report a perfectly stable experience, but I did suffer a couple of crashes during my playthrough. I may have really nitpicked this game, and in truth there are definitely some things to criticize here, but Horizon Forbidden West is a great experience overall: from the combat to the graphics to the sheer amount of content the game packs in. Yet compared to its predecessor I honestly still think Zero Dawn might be the better game. Forbidden West comes across like an indulgent double album after an artist wins a Grammy (on PS4, the game actually comes on two discs): captivating and expansive, yet messier, rougher and lacking in the tightness of craft that won them the accolades in the first place. That being said, Horizon Forbidden West is still a heck of a lot of game for your money, and no fan of the first game should miss out on playing it.",4.3,,,178917
https://www.mobygames.com/user/1025180/subsonick/,Hitman review for people that read hitman reviews,"The Good This is the best game I've ever played gameplay-wise. Putting it into words doesn't do it justice. You can interact with nearly anything, and the clever player can turn anything anywhere into an assassination opportunity in any of the semi-open world maps. Not to mention, Agent 47's veteran voice returned to the series, keeping the same stoic personality fans have known since the beginning. Cutscenes look great, and the in-game graphics, while not revolutionary, still hold up well. The Bad The story takes a backseat, especially during escalations.

https://www.mobygames.com/user/68871/vedder/,Step aside XCOM. There's a new #1.,"The Good XCOM meets Into the Breach. The Bad I could nitpick that the XP mechanic is entirely arbitrary and appears to be completely outside the player's influence. Or how finishing all optional goals in the same session could've been rewarded in some way (with something superficial like a shinier star or achievements). But the reality is there aren't really any bad elements to point out. The Bottom Line Tactical Breach Wizards is a sublime mix between XCOM and Into the Breach. Where I really loved Into the Breach's full information mechanics, I couldn't really get into the rogue-like structure of the game. Tactical Breach Wizards instead presents itself with a wonderfully crafted single player campaign and a collection of loose optional dreams. Each level is a manually crafted puzzle on its own and there's a consistent influx of new team members, abilities, and upgrades which keeps things fresh. Because of the full information of what's going to happen there's never quite that anticipation moment when firing, that XCOM does so well. Nor do we ever feel the loss of one of our long-surviving team mates, but we get a lot in return. The puzzles are carefully crafted and with infinite undoes your are fully free to experiment. There's a lot of ways all the powers work together and throughout the game you'll start to learn them all through experimentation. There's a nice mix of levels in which I felt I could ""solve"" it in multiple ways, while in others they clearly try to teach you new trick. You'll often feel smart about finding some new combo. Which in occasional situations can become extremely overpowered, but what works well in one level doesn't necessarily work in the next, due to the composition of the team, shape of the level, types of enemies, other interactive elements in the level, and your actual goals. The conversations in between levels serve well to give the characters some personality and keep the story going. None of the characters follow any familiar class system and instead really feel like a ragtag bunch because of it. The focus on moving enemies around rather than directly damaging them is an incredibly fun gameplay mechanic, although the balance shifts a bit more towards damage dealing later in the game with more heavy damage powers becoming available. While a different beast than XCOM, being more of a puzzle game, and less about gambling with lives. Counting them both as ""Turn Based Tactics"" games, I think I finally found the game that dethrones XCOM from the top position.",5,,,229435

It plays very similarly to the first three games. For better or for worse. While I have fond memories of those games, perhaps I see them too much with rose tinted glasses. Return to Monkey Island frequently made me feel like I played this game already. There's a distinct lack of innovation. If you just want more of the same, this'll be straight up you alley. Since most of the game's target audience will have nostalgic memories of the originals, this sequel is unlikely to become anyone's favourite. The puzzles Are generally well thought out and not too obtuse, although it does kind of require you to remember every single little detail of every location, or multiple visits to be reminded about them. Something many games in this genre suffer from. A welcome layered in-game hints system is probably the best innovation in this game. I certainly used it a couple times, not so much because I didn't understand how to solve a puzzle, but more because I didn't want to revisit all areas just to find a particular object. Especially in the later more open part of the game. All in all it's a solid adventure game, with good voice acting, nice visuals, lots of style and charm. It's absurdity will paint a smile on your face at times, but will rarely make you laugh out loud. But by offering nothing really new it leans a bit too much on the nostalgia pillar to really stand out.",3,,,191783
,The terrible ending of a legendary franchise,"The Good Graphics: People were hating it, but to me this style is a truthful evolution from the pixelgraphics design. Small legs, big head- very cute. Soundtrack is a 11 out of 10- Michael Land is a genius and each time just gets better. Voiceacting is perfect. The Bad The storyline. Right from the beginning, you know where it will end. Like everything is dying. Mele Island is empty, the Scumm Bar burns down. Herman Toothrot had a small but stupid cameo. 
Ron Gilbert is for sure an old grumpy gamer. You can feel how much frustration he put into killing this franchise- mainly because he is OLD! And yeah, even in the credits, he mentions that. Yes, we all know you are old now and young back then- but let me tell this: Nobody cares! Nobody cares that you have a good wife and family. I mean, I'm indeed happy for you, but nobody cares when you're making a game. A fictional story. My idea for your next game: Put in the final stage a huge sign that says that everything is just bullshit and imagination; because one day we all die, the world is horrible and that you hate everything. -THE END- The Bottom Line Don't pay more than 20 bucks for a computergame. Whish I listened to that advice and just got it on sale or maybe free on XBOX live or crap. Now serious. As a game itself, for modern times, it's just good enough. New gamers will love it but standards are low for the current generation, anyways where people are overwhelmed or traumatized by ""walking simulators"". RIP Guybrush",1,,,191783

The price The Bottom Line I didn't know what to expect from the game, other than that it was about Prosecutor Edgeworth and seemed to share a universe with the characters from the original trilogy. I started playing after finishing the one set in the British Empire, where I was driven mad by the huge... HUGE... amount of time spent investigating different locations and crime scenes, constantly going ""blah blah blah blah"" with every single person and squinting to find tiny little items. Thank God, there's none of that here! Everything is much more concise, although there are moments when it's frustrating that you can't figure out who to ask or what to show to move the plot forward (but to be fair, that's a problem with most games in the series). But the most unexpected gift awaited me in the concept of the so-called ""proceedings."" I was so happy when, just a couple of minutes into the case, the cross-examination started—getting straight to the point, as they say. But to be honest, I didn't expect it and at first, I was thinking: ""When is the trial going to start?"", ""Why are they dragging out the trial for so long?"", ""What's with all this unnecessary pre-trial chatter?"" I thought they decided to compensate for the short investigation time this way, but boy, was I wrong... Gameplay and Mechanics These games mainly have two major gameplay loops that take up most of the time: The first is the familiar visual navigation between slideshow-like backdrops of locations, clicking on pixels, and talking to the people there by selecting dialogue options and presenting evidence to get them to reveal new information or unlock a new dialogue topic. The second is examining the murder scene, or a special place that raises questions for our brilliant prosecutor. Now we control a little chibi character ourselves from a distant, top-down 3rd person perspective. We walk around the room, clicking on everything and seeing what our hero has to say. Sometimes we click on objects for a closer look and compare them with items in our inventory, finding a contradiction which gives us a new piece of evidence. Also, during the on-site investigation, we need to use ""Logic"" - a new mechanic that allows you to connect the prosecutor's deductions to form some meaningful conclusion, like data about the killer, the weapon, the motive, a special item, and so on. It's a pretty simple thing, of course, but it's a decent little break from clicking pixels in the sand. (photo of the chibi in 2 styles: pixel and regular 3D). In the game, you can choose between 2 graphic styles during investigations - chibi and pixel
In the game, you can choose between 2 graphic styles during investigations - chibi and pixel
Sometimes there are moments when the developers remember they need to do something to diversify the gameplay and give us a ""taste,"" so to speak, of new (old) gadgets that we'll use once in a blue moon for 1 minute and immediately forget about afterward. I'm talking about the metal detector (looking for a beeping pixel on the screen), the fingerprint search (you just have to blow (I'm not a druggie) white powder on a texture and apply it again for the fingerprint to appear), and the photo/video analyzer (this one I actually really liked. You have to zoom in on specific areas of a photo/video to find a clue. Or in a video, you have to select a specific moment of the recording, and only then zoom in on certain parts of the frame. I think this feature was very successful and I would have liked to use it more in the game). There's also a crime scene reconstructor for the past, to find evidence that should have existed at some point but is no longer there. But this is more related to the investigation mechanic than a separate tool. This feature is okay, but nothing special). As for the second game, they added a cool mechanic called ""Logic Chess"" or Mind Games. It's a rather witty idea used to convince an opponent to tell our hero all their secrets by provoking them and goading them into talking more than they should. And there are even funny lines if you choose the wrong dialogue options. And it's all timed! Every wrong answer reduces your time. When you're given dialogue choices, you have to think about what to pick, and time is limited! This adds a bit of interest and pace to the game. After a correct answer, you destroy one of the opponent's ""pieces"" and checkmate them, with a slick sound effect and a satisfied look on the prosecutor's face)) Plot and Characters of Part 1 I'll try to keep it spoiler-free and speak in general terms. The story revolves around a smuggling ring. The plot connects all the cases in the first game. But the problem is that you lose interest, as the events are engaging at first and then you immediately lose the desire to get into the case's plot, or it's uninteresting from the start, like in the amusement park case. The final case is especially so - it's intriguing at the beginning and in the middle, giving you hope that finally! A really interesting case, even if it's at the end of the game.... But no, because the last part of the case is so dragged out with unnecessary actions, dialogue, finding evidence that's already obvious, or listening to people who are completely unnecessary here. Because of this, the last case feels as long as 3 cases combined! I'm just shocked at how they can drag out a villain's confession like that. I'd be willing to tolerate it if the reasons why the villain can't be exposed right now were varied. Although the overall plot of the final case was decent in my opinion, with colorful characters, which can't be said for the gameplay slog throughout the whole case. Therefore, the plot of this part gets a 5 out of 10. And by the way, this part and the next are full of references to characters from the original trilogy, so fans will enjoy seeing familiar faces. The characters.... Well, the devs didn't disappoint here and added folks who nicely complement our prosecutor hero and oppose him. For example, Detective Shi-Long Lang, who constantly quotes some fictional sage named Lang Zi: ""Every wolf bites at exactly midnight, unless it is already noon."" Every one of his alpha quotes is gold and you'll definitely love them. And he's the only one who can talk on equal terms with a certain stern character from past games. There's also Detective Badd, who radiates macho man energy with a grumpy face and a stick in his mouth (though I thought it was a cigarette). A super-brutal dude who only speaks facts and loves to admire himself in the mirror. There are also a couple of background characters who are interesting and try to confuse you about their involvement, so I'm happy with them, although all the other background characters are very boring. That one little punk who yells ""Not so fast!"" every time you're wrong by default
That one little punk who yells ""Not so fast!"" every time you're wrong by default
As for the villains, it's highly debatable. Only the last one and the very first one were memorable (and the first one only because of his overconfident fool persona). As for the second most important villain, he's memorable, but more as a personality; the plot twist with him is quite good (twice, even!). You're probably wondering, what about the other villains? It's simple - they're useless, just there to check a box, and you only remember them on the third or fourth try. That's how boring they are. So you can maybe add a point for the final boss, but for the rest.....Bruh Plot and Characters of Part 2 HEY, HEY, HEY! Who would have thought that Part 2 would be the complete opposite of Part 1 in terms of its flaws!!! And no, I'm not saying the pros became cons and the cons became pros. This part has only pros! Yes... even I couldn't believe until the end that this part is so perfect in terms of plot and characters that any minor flaws, if they even exist, are simply wiped out by the HUGE pluses of this story. The devs carried over the idea of an interconnected plot across all cases from Part 1, but my God, how brilliantly they executed it here.... Every case never let you forget that it didn't just come out of nowhere, but is genuinely important and significant for understanding what the hell is going on here. The main villain here is a complete surprise; I had no idea who was behind it all until the very end and thought a completely different person was guilty. The developers even managed to salvage a boring case from the past involving the hero's father, thanks to the nuances and decisiveness of the villain (who you don't guess right away either). Respect for that. It's been a long time since I've felt such ecstasy playing through cases in a prosecutor/attorney game... That's how blown away I was by the plot. 10 out of 10, no questions asked. The characters.... Hmm... Maybe the developers cheaped out and skimped a little here? Overruled! The characters in Part 2 are simply magnificent, especially our opponents in deduction - Judge Courtney (an annoying bitch who is always factually correct in her remarks), and Prosecutor Eustace Winner (literally me IRL). You'd have to try hard to come up with such colorful characters, even though at first it seemed they were only good at annoying us. But as you progress through the game, they develop significantly as individuals. The side characters here are also great and do their best to throw us off track, making us think there's something wrong with them. So I can only applaud the developers for the work they've done. Menu Sections I really liked that there's an option here to view all the sprites for each character separately (their objections, animations, their breakdowns from the truth, etc.), and their movement animations during investigations. There's also a gallery of art, posters, promotional photo landscapes, and early character concepts, which lets you see that the concepts are sometimes better than the final version (heh heh). And it's impossible not to mention that the game's soundtrack (which is as wonderful here as the one in the British game) can be listened to in its entirety in the game, especially the pursuit themes, and it's all free (Isn't that right, Capcom?). Conclusion The first part, Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth - 6 out of 10. It's clear the developers were trying to explore a lot in terms of new mechanics and characters here, and it was more of a trial run than a deliberate attempt to create a masterpiece. The second part, Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor's Gambit - an unconditional 10 out of 10 and unequivocally the best part of the entire series in terms of plot, intrigue, and characters (on par with the best). Overall score for the collection is 10 out of 10, thanks to the influence of Part 2. Believe me, it's worth playing the whole collection just for that game.",5,,,230077

Regardless, once you accept that role you are in for a treat of puzzle game. The game is full of deductive puzzles which slowly ramp up in difficulty and complexity. One layer of complexity I found quite nice is how at some point you'll be switching back to older puzzles just to figure out some character's possible motive or whereabouts. The scenes are also very ambiguous which often set you on the wrong foot and rarely put you in a position to solve the ""case"" after a cursory glance.

closer to The Beginner's Guide or The Hex . And it may be the best game of this kind I have ever played after Pony Island . I can't talk at all about the story without spoilers so I'll have to keep this recommendation vague. The only thing I can say is that the humor is splendid and I laughed out loud often. While the story is clearly king, this does not mean the gameplay has been neglected. On the contrary, the puzzles are the most inventive I have seen in a long time. Again, I can't reveal anything without spoilers, but the integration of story and gameplay is fantastic. This game is full of puzzles I have never seen before and they manage to be logical and non-trivial at the same time. If you ever get stuck there is an excellent hint system which gives first vague and then more explicit hints. The controls are obviously designed for touch devices, but still work well with mouse. The Bad Most sections were significantly too long and a later part of the plot, let's call it a love story, was a bit silly and did not really work for me.

https://www.mobygames.com/user/179990/krisko6/,"New Generation, New Spider-Man","The Good * A great technical showcase for the PS5 launch: speedy load times, ray-traced reflections, and new weather effects make for a more immersive experience. Miles' new abilities are fun to use. A mostly-solid continuation of the story from the first game. The Bad * A very familiar experience to the first game Game is shorter and smaller in scale than the first, between a DLC and a full campaign. Some annoying boss fights drag down the fun. The Bottom Line In the fall of 2018, Sony and developer Insomniac Games launched what would be known as one of the PlayStation 4’s defining titles: Spider-Man. The game’s lavish production values, open-world web traversal, enjoyable combat, and cinematic storytelling made for an enjoyable comic-book power fantasy. With the dawn of a new console generation and the power afforded to the developers, Insomiac decided to return to their reimagined Marvel universe and continue the story by focusing on a new character taking up the Spider-Man mantle: Miles Morales. Somewhere between a DLC and a sequel, the game largely sticks to the template established by its predecessor while offering up a few new wrinkles of its own. Continuing where the previous games’ DLC left off, the story is set some time after the original game around the holiday season. Miles has spent some time learning how to use his newfound spider powers under Peter Parker’s tutelage. One day, Parker decides to leave New York on vacation with his girlfriend over in Europe, entrusting Miles with the responsibility of being New York’s only Spider-Man. That’s also when Miles begins to discover that he has some unique abilities of his own which Parker doesn’t possess. New enemies emerge over the holiday break as Miles is caught in a war between Roxxon, a corporation offering a new clean energy source and an eco-terrorist resistance known as The Underground. Miles must split his time with protecting his neighborhood from these new threats while also dealing with the highs and lows that come with the holiday season. As with the first game, the game’s story presentation is highly cinematic, fitting more with the tone of the Sam Raimi/Tobey McGuire-era Spider-Man films than any other incarnation, although with Miles as the star there’s also a bit of the acclaimed animated feature Into The Spider-Verse mixed in as well. We’re given a much greater exploration of Miles’ domestic life compared to the first game, as he’s still a high school student unlike the post-grad Peter Parker. Much like Into the Spider-Verse, the soundtrack mixes the traditional orchestral stylings of the first game with drum machines, electronic beats, and even songs with vocals, giving an urban, hip-hop flavor to this particular Spider-Man. There’s even a suit mod you can unlock which mimics the annoyingly choppy, stop-motion comic book animation style from that film, even if that looks incredibly out of place in the photo-realistic world of Insomniac’s games. One thing that might throw some people off is that the voice of Peter Parker has been completely recast for this installment. That being said, the new actor does an excellent job with the role and I barely noticed it after a while. The presentation is only enhanced with the new possibilities afforded by the next-generation PS5 hardware. Despite also being available on the PS4, Miles Morales is clearly designated as Sony’s flagship, showcase launch title for the system. The PS5’s speedy SSD allows for unbelievably quick loading times when booting up the game, while the enhanced draw distance and ray-traced reflections offer up a more immersive New York. New weather effects this time around include snow, intense blizzards, and fog, although as with the first game every time of day is pre-set for each story mission, and there is no true day-to-night cycle. There’s a calm, serene beauty to the falling snow and Christmas lights which contrasts nicely with the fast-paced comic-book action of the gameplay. There’s also a performance mode, which shuts off the more advanced graphical features but doubles the framerate, allowing for an unbelievably smooth and fluid 60 FPS game experience that puts the previous generation incarnation to shame. While no single enhancement truly blew me away individually, all of these features collectively make for an impressive experience at the outset of a new generation. Insomniac has also remade the original game’s campaign using these new features and upgrades as well, allowing you to transfer your game across generations, although you’ll need to purchase the ultimate edition to download this. That being said, I did witness a couple of crashes as I made my way through this game’s campaign, so perhaps there’s a few next-generation kinks left to iron out. Spider-Man Miles Morales doesn’t exactly reinvent the wheel when it comes to its overall game experience. Even though Miles is supposed to be a rookie compared to the far more experienced Peter in the first game, the way the game feels to play is remarkably similar. You’ll still swing around New York as Spider-Man with the same basic control scheme as before, completing various objectives and earning skill points and tokens to invest in upgrading Miles’ abilities and suits. You’ll still battle waves of faceless goons from various factions using different combo moves as well as gadgets. The open world of New York is largely the same apart from being gussied up for Christmas, and new interiors have been added for specific missions. And random crimes and objectives will pop up constantly to reward you with experience points and tokens that can be used to unlock new skills and suits. A hero’s work is never done, it seems. There have been some changes and streamlining, however. First, the Pipe Dream-style puzzle sections which were meant to simulate Parker’s scientist occupation have been completely axed in favor of environmental puzzles, a smart idea in theory. However these are disappointingly basic, and rarely, if ever had me stumped for long. Generally, the puzzles come down to either using web to connect electric wires, using Miles’ bioelectric abilities to charge generators or punch through walls, or using web to hold a mechanism in place to keep a door open. That’s where the second major difference comes in, as instead of each suit having its own special ability when the special meter is full, Miles utilizes his own bioelectric “Venom” attacks which stun enemies and open them up for extra damage. You’ll need this to break the guard of the new enemy types introduced in this game, and it also allows for a fair amount of crowd control. The downside is that each suit feels a bit less unique, although some of them are still pretty cool. As you progress through the game, you’ll unlock increasingly powerful venom attacks, starting from a punch and eventually graduating to using a full, screen-clearing attack which knocks out just about everybody around you. Later on, Miles can also turn invisible using his camouflage power, which is highly useful for stealth and avoiding hairy situations during combat. I’ve even been able to escape combat entirely and go back into stealth when using this during a few instances. That being said, I feel that the length of time Miles can become invisible is a bit too long, however, and its a bit too easy to just walk around and web everyone unseen. This ability, while awesome to use, could have used a bit of nerfing. While the first game constantly shifted the player’s perspective between Peter Parker and the unpowered Miles Morales and Mary Jane, I found this to be a choice which didn’t pay off. We want to play as Spider-Man in our Spider-Man game! This time around there are no such perspective shifts and we’re playing as Miles for the entire game although there are a couple of flashbacks to Miles’ life as an ordinary kid. While the first game was loaded with huge set pieces and big boss battles, Mile Morales dials things back a bit due to its shorter campaign. Most of the story missions are focused around the Harlem area as opposed to all of New York. There are some nifty set pieces involving a mall, a bridge, and a few major boss battles, and all of these offer the kind of spectacle seen in the first game: there just isn’t as much of it. One boss battle in the back half of the game is easily the most annoying fight between the two campaigns, and if it weren’t for the game’s forgiving checkpointing I might have chosen to dial down the difficulty for a bit. Spider-Man Miles Morales does the PS5 proud as its inaugural AAA title, offering a great superhero experience. However, it rests so much on the foundation laid by its predecessor that there really isn’t much left to go beyond continuing the story and streamlining a few aspects and adding some new powers for its new character. Much like Miles himself, It’s a game that cannot quite escape the long shadow of its predecessor despite possessing some of its own identity. That said, if you enjoyed the first part then you’ll also like this one as well.",4.3,,,153496

https://www.mobygames.com/user/1028227/m-nils/,A chance to experience the best SNES game never released in the west,"The Good Live A Live is an episodic JRPG with eight chapters spanning a wide range of settings and time periods, from prehistoric times to Edo Japan to a spaceship in the far future. The original game was released in 1994 on the Super Nintendo, when Square was at their peak (it came out right along the Final Fantasy series, Secret of Mana and Chrono Trigger). Apparently, it sold poorly enough in Japan for them to never bother releasing it in the West. For a long time, the only way to play it outside Japan was to get your hands on an imported copy (or a ROM) and either learn Japanese or track down a fan translation patch. Needless to say, this remake, 28 years later, came as a major surprise! What makes Live A Live special comes down to mostly two things: The sheer variety of settings and the unique combat mechanics. The game initially lets you choose from seven chapters running between one to three hours, which you can play in any order and a final one that unlocks once you completed the others. While the finale loosely connects the heroes’ paths, for the most part, each chapter is completely unique. Take the Wild West one, for example. It’s a fairly short but memorable chapter in which an outlaw named Sundown unites with a bounty hunter to help a small town set up traps within a time limit and defeat an evil gang of bandits. Then you have a story set on board of a space ship in the far future in which you play a spherical robot called Cube facing various flavors of space horror. One sprawling chapter involves a ninja on a mission to rescue a prisoner from an enemy castle in Edo Japan. Another, set in prehistoric times, focuses on slapstick humor as characters communicate using symbols in speech bubbles rather than written dialogue. The chapter set in present times is purely focused on combat with individual fights set up as underground sporting events, Street Fighter style. A chapter in ancient China involves an aging kung fu master searching for disciples to teach his secret technique to a new generation and a near-future chapter involves a biker gang, telepathy and a giant robot. The range of settings, characters and play styles is truly staggering. Chapters can be fairly short, which might have contributed to the game being poorly received in 1994 but a more modern view would be that there is remarkable little filler and grind. Once an idea is played out, the game moves on to the next. The other stand-out is the unique combat mechanic. Combat has traditionally been one of the weaker aspects of JRPGs with winning or losing mostly depending on your characters' stats or equipment. Any planning or strategy revolved around grinding to level up your character or following simple rock-paper-scissors rules such as fighting an ice monster with fire attacks. Live A Live does all the classic JRPG combat tropes but it also adds something new: Positioning. Combat plays out on a 7x7 grid and characters and enemies take turns to either fight or move to a different tile. Attacks have a tile pattern (for example firing a gun diagonally or affecting all adjacent tiles). Tiles can also have status effects applied to them like fire or poison, forcing an opponent to either use their turn to flee or receive damage. While most fights are too easy to be much of a challenge, this elevates combat from simply spamming the attack with the highest damage, adding a lot of strategy. It’s an example of what JRPGs could have achieved if they dared to experiment with the formula a bit more. The Bad There are moments where this game being 30 years old shows and it’s mostly in how little it cares about the player getting lost. Despite the remake adding a radar and splash screen tutorials, some of the labyrinthine designs and lack of real mission objectives mean that you often find yourself running around aimlessly in hopes of triggering a random event that pushes the story forward. I prefer not to use external guides as getting lost can be part of the charm (and very much be intended by the designers) but occasionally had to give up and looked things up online. Also, of course, the episodic nature makes it hard to really dive deep into any character. I would have been more okay with that if the final chapter connected all characters in a more in-depth way but it mostly feels like it was done as an afterthought. As for the remake aspect, it’s a bit of a mixed bag. The voice acting ranges from decent to cringe-worthy and I found myself switching it off in some chapters. The 2.5D graphics are a strange mix of 16bit-era sprites for characters and environments with 3D perspective and occasionally full-polygon elements. Text is rendered sharply in full resolution and so are all menus (which annoyingly leads to a 2 second delay every time you enter the character menu). Environmental and particle effects also seem to be full resolution and picked from some Unreal Engine library. While on the SNES, the pixelated art style grew out of cleverly solving the limitations of the hardware, in 2022 it's mostly just a vague reference, an imitation and, most importantly, a shortcut. It feels bit jarring and dare I say… tacky. Why not go fully 3D or stay in a lower resolution aesthetic consistently? On top of that, one of the more interesting aspects about the SNES original is that each chapter was drawn by different manga artists, adding some unique styles and flavors, which are mostly lost in this remake. Sometimes it’s ok to let a decades old game be a decades old game. I probably would have preferred an official release of the SNES original to soak in the historical context of the game over playing a version with superficial polish. The Bottom Line All in all, Live A Live is probably one of the most interesting oldschool JRPGs to currently play, despite its limitations. I don’t know if it’s the „best“ in terms of polish or depth but there is no other game of this genre that lets you experience so much variety in such a tight package. I have to praise Square Enix for bothered to remake such an obscure (and, back then, financially unsuccessful) game for modern audiences. Other remakes often feel lazy, especially on the Switch where they sometimes fill huge gaps in the release schedule that could be taken by actually new games. But with Live A Live, there genuinely hasn’t been a way for Western audiences to play this game for 30 years so it feels suprisingly fresh.",4,,,188012
