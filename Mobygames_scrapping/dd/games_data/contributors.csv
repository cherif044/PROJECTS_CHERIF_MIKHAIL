47337,Shinji Mikami,"Shinji Mikami (三上 真司), born on 11 August 1965, is a Japanese game designer best known for his work on the Resident Evil series. After graduating from Doshisha University, Mikami was hired by Capcom in 1990 as a game planner. During his early years at the company he mostly worked on Disney-licensed titles, including Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1991), Aladdin (1993) and Goof Troop (1994). Mikami's next step was to create a game based on the earlier Capcom title Sweet Home . The idea was a horror-themed game where a team of special forces were trapped inside a mansion infested with zombies and other monsters. The game was called Biohazard , and was renamed Resident Evil upon its release in the United States. The game became an unexpected hit for Capcom, and a sequel was soon commissioned. Eventually Resident Evil grew into a successful franchise under the supervision of Shinji Mikami. Capcom then asked Mikami to create another survival horror series, which became known as Dino Crisis . Capcom then decided to establish Production Studio 4 as a means of keeping the survival horror team together, and appointed Shinji Mikami as the General Manager of the studio. With his new position, Mikami worked as executive producer on most Studio 4 titles including Dino Crisis 2 , Phoenix Wright and Devil May Cry (originally conceived as the fourth Resident Evil title). In 2001, Mikami made a controversial decision to make all future Studio 4 games exclusive to the Nintendo GameCube, despite it not being the leading format at the time. The first GameCube exclusive was a remake of the original Resident Evil which was to realize Mikami's true vision of the game, and well as a prequel Resident Evil Zero . Neither of these two games sold as well as Capcom had hoped, but Mikami decided to pursue his GameCube exclusivity, and announced five new games which he dubbed the ""Capcom 5"". Of the five GameCube exclusives, Mikami was to direct one title himself ( P.N.03 ) and act as producer on the remaining four titles ( Viewtiful Joe , Dead Phoenix, killer7 and Resident Evil 4 ). P.N.03 and Viewtiful Joe were the first of the Capcom 5 released. The Mikami-directed P.N.03 was a critical and commercial failure, while Viewtiful Joe gained praise but still failed to reach sales targets. Capcom's disappointment with the Capcom 5 grew more evident, as Dead Phoenix was cancelled and Viewtiful Joe was ported to the PlayStation 2, breaking Mikami's exclusivity agreement with Nintendo. Mikami voluntarily stepped down as General Manager of Production Studio 4 but still remained a member of the team. With the failure of P.N.03 now behind him, Mikami decided to concentrate on the creative aspects of the remaining Capcom 5 titles and took over directorial duties on Resident Evil 4. Under his direction, the Resident Evil series went through an evolution of changes. Resident Evil 4 was then released to critical acclaim and became a big selling title on the GameCube. As with Viewtiful Joe, Resident Evil 4 was later ported to the PlayStation 2 but Mikami refused to be involved in the conversion. That same year, Mikami co-wrote the story for the final Capcom 5 game killer7, which received mixed reviews. Shortly after the success of Resident Evil 4, Shinji Mikami departed from Capcom Production Studio 4 and joined many of his former colleagues at Clover Studio. Originally founded in 2004, Clover Studio was established by Capcom with the aim of creating new, original and innovative IPs, and its development staff was largely made up of former Resident Evil and Devil May Cry members. While working at Clover, Mikami supervised the development of an old-school style beat 'em up called God Hand. In 2006 Clover Studio was dissolved by Capcom following disappointing sales of its games Okami and God Hand, and Mikami resigned from Capcom along with many other Clover Studio staff. Soon after Clover's closure, Shinji Mikami, along with Atsushi Inaba (Clover Studio founder) and Hideki Kamiya (Devil May Cry creator) formed a new development studio called Seeds Inc. The company then changed its name to Platinum Games in a merger with ODD corporation. In 2009, Shinji Mikami worked at Platinum Games to direct Bayonetta . In March 2010, it was revealed he established a new development studio called Tango Gameworks . He worked as the executive producer until 2023.",Wikipedia (en): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinji_Mikami; Insane Genius: http://www.freewebs.com/resident_evil_fun/shinji.htm; @shinji_mikami: https://twitter.com/shinji_mikami; Resident Evil Creator Mikami Reflects on the Series' Roots: https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-creator-shinji-mikami-reflects-on-th/1100-6435918/

In 1992, Square hired him to work on the battle graphics of Final Fantasy V and then as graphic director in 1994 for Final Fantasy VI . In 1996, a game project called Silent Chaos (which was originally the sequel of Dark Earth ) was stopped after several months of development, and became a PlayStation game, developed in collaboration with Square. The characters, designed by François Rimasson at the beginning, were re-designed later by Tetsuya Nomura; but the project was never completed, and Silent Chaos was cancelled in November 1999, after two and a half years of development. Nomura's first major breakthrough came in 1997, when Square asked him to become character designer for Final Fantasy VII . In 1998, he worked on both Parasite Eve and Brave Fencer Musashi . The following year he impressed his superiors with his realistic character design in Final Fantasy VIII . He was given not only the job of character designer but also of battle visual director. Square then asked him to work on several other projects and decided to choose him to be character designer for their first game on PlayStation 2 ( The Bouncer ) and then for their first Final Fantasy installment on that console ( Final Fantasy X ). He continued working on Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts games.",nomuratetsuya.net: http://nomuratetsuya.net/; Tetsuya Nomura profile: http://squarehaven.com/people/Tetsuya-Nomura/

In 1992, Square hired him to work on the battle graphics of Final Fantasy V and then as graphic director in 1994 for Final Fantasy VI . In 1996, a game project called Silent Chaos (which was originally the sequel of Dark Earth ) was stopped after several months of development, and became a PlayStation game, developed in collaboration with Square. The characters, designed by François Rimasson at the beginning, were re-designed later by Tetsuya Nomura; but the project was never completed, and Silent Chaos was cancelled in November 1999, after two and a half years of development. Nomura's first major breakthrough came in 1997, when Square asked him to become character designer for Final Fantasy VII . In 1998, he worked on both Parasite Eve and Brave Fencer Musashi . The following year he impressed his superiors with his realistic character design in Final Fantasy VIII . He was given not only the job of character designer but also of battle visual director. Square then asked him to work on several other projects and decided to choose him to be character designer for their first game on PlayStation 2 ( The Bouncer ) and then for their first Final Fantasy installment on that console ( Final Fantasy X ). He continued working on Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts games.",nomuratetsuya.net: http://nomuratetsuya.net/; Tetsuya Nomura profile: http://squarehaven.com/people/Tetsuya-Nomura/

3,Sid Meier,"Often called the ""Father of Computer Gaming"", Sid Meier has been honored with virtually every major award in the gaming industry and in 1999, was the second person ever to be inducted into the Academy of Interactive Arts and Science's ""Hall of Fame."" His career in the industry started in 1982, when he founded MicroProse together with Bill Stealey . The first game he wrote for the company was Chopper Rescue . After initially working on combat flight simulator and military strategy games, he achieved his real fame with his Civilization game (1991). Before the release of the game, he had already been bought out of the company by Stealey, and Meier had become a private contractor, working seemingly exclusively for the company. He received money up front, more when the game delivered and royalties on each sold copy. The Vice President that replaced Meier at the company did not receive any bonuses on the Meier titles sold and therefore gave them low priority at the company. In 1996, he left MicroProse to join the newly-founded Firaxis Games by Jeff Briggs . In 1997, the company’s first release was Sid Meier's Gettysburg! , followed by Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri in 1999, which was enhanced later in the year with Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire . Firaxis then released two more games, Sid Meier's Civilization III and Sid Meier's SimGolf . In 2004 and 2005, his original Pirates! game was remade as Sid Meier's Pirates! and the Civilization series was continued with Civilization IV .","IMDB: nm1027075: https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1027075/; Wikipedia (en): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Meier; PlayStation.com Interview (June 4, 2007): https://www.us.playstation.com/News/Editorials/53; Sid Meier on Civ Revolution and his next plans - 02.02.2008: http://www.gamersglobal.com/special/interview/sid-meier-on-civilization-revolution-and-his-next-plans; Sid Meier: On a Wing and a Dare: http://www.apple.com/games/articles/2008/05/sidmeier/; Feature Creep Studios Inc.: http://www.featurecreepstudios.com/; Sid Meier interview: http://www.retrogamer.net/profiles/developer/sid-meier/"

His first work was Megalopolice, a Japanese motion ride with computer graphics. He then turned his attention to racing simulations, and in 1995 created the arcade game Sega Rally Championship . Mizuguchi is also known for his work on Manx TT , Rez, and Space Channel 5 , among other best selling titles. In 1996, Mizuguchi left Sega's AM3 division to form AM Annex , where he and his team created Sega Touring Car Championship and Sega Rally Championship. On April 9, 2000, Sega's amusement division ""AM9"" became United Game Artists (UGA) . Mizuguchi was President and Chief Operating Officer of the studio. They produced Space Channel 5 and Rez, which were praised among gaming communities as fresh and innovative titles. On October 7, 2003, Mizuguchi was a guest on ""Tokyo Game Lounge"", a webcast radio program produced in Tokyo. During the webcast, he announced his retirement from Sega. An article by Hirohiko Niizumi/Tor Thorsen for GameSpot claims that the restructuring prompted Mizuguchi to leave the company. He explained of departure from Sega as follows: ""Games are a very unique medium. They exist beyond language, beyond culture, and people are fascinated by games. I don't know how long I will live, but I want to learn more about games -- and there is more to learn about creating better games."" After leaving Sega, Mizuguchi co-founded Q Entertainment with other former Sega employees. He left the company in 2014 when he founded Enhance, Inc. He is, as of May 2021, both the CEO and the sole employee of the company.",Tetsuya Mizuguchi Weblog: http://mizuguchi.biz/; Interview with Mizuguchi: http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=10474; Tetsuya Mizuguchi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetsuya_Mizuguchi; @mizuguchitter: https://twitter.com/mizuguchitter
